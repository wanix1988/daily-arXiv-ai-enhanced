While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can generate and edit images, most existing multi-turn benchmarks and training recipes are effectively Markov: the next output depends primarily on the most recent image, enabling shortcut solutions that ignore long-range history. In this work we formalize and target the more challenging non-Markov setting, where a user may refer back to earlier states, undo changes, or reference entities introduced several rounds ago. We present (i) non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, including rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states and name-based multi-round personalization that binds names to appearances across rounds; (ii) a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching to prevent multi-round identity drift; and (iii) enabling improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization, including a reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum. We demonstrate that explicitly training for non-Markov interactions yields substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance, while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u591a\u8f6e\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u53ca\u589e\u5f3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5386\u53f2\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u4ece\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u7528\u6237\u56de\u6eaf\u3001\u64a4\u9500\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u591a\u8f6e\u5f15\u7528\u5b9e\u4f53\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u56de\u6eda\u5f0f\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u540d\u79f0\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u7d22\u65e9\u671f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u540d\u79f0\u4e0e\u5f62\u8c61\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u591a\u8f6e\u6b21\u4e2d\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u6b21\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u4ece\u6027\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u591a\u8f6e\u6b21\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

In recent years, several solutions have been proposed to correct LPP artifacts, either in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, which are expensive to collect. Moreover, existing approaches focus solely either on image-space or sinogram-space correction, ignoring the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. In this work, we propose an unrolled dual-domain method based on synthetic data to correct LPP artifacts. Specifically, the intrinsic correlations of LPP between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data generated from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring any real-world clinical data. In experiments simulating 1-2% detectors defect near the isocenter, the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. The results indicate that our solution can correct LPP artifacts without the cost of data collection for model training, and it is adaptable to different scanner settings for software-based applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53cc\u57df\u9000\u5377\u79ef\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4fee\u6b63CT\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u50cf\u7d20\uff08LPP\uff09\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u62df1-2%\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6545\u969c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684LPP\u77eb\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e00\u9886\u57df\uff08\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u6216\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u57df\uff09\u77eb\u6b63\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528CT\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9000\u5377\u79ef\u6280\u672f\uff08Unrolled Dual-Domain Method\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u77eb\u6b63LPP\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u57281-2%\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6545\u969c\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u65e0\u9700\u6536\u96c6\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540cCT\u626b\u63cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53cc\u57df\u9000\u5377\u79ef\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709LPP\u77eb\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3aCT\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Quantifying Interaction Effects in Peer Review", "comment": "28 pages", "summary": "There are increasing indications that LLMs are not only used for producing scientific papers, but also as part of the peer review process. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher. This suggests that meta-reviewers do not merely outsource the decision-making to the LLM. These findings provide important input for developing policies that govern the use of LLMs during peer review, and they more generally indicate how LLMs interact with existing decision-making processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7125,000\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5bf9LLM\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u7136LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4f3c\u4e4e\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u66f4\u53cb\u597d\u5730\u5bf9\u5f85LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u4f46\u63a7\u5236\u8bba\u6587\u8d28\u91cf\u540e\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u5373LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u5ba1\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u8bba\u6587\u5bbd\u677e\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b8c\u5168\u7531LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bc4\u5ba1\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u8bc4\u7ea7\u538b\u7f29\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u8bba\u6587\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\uff0cLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u5143\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u5143\u8bc4\u5ba1\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u7ed9\u51fa\u63a5\u53d7\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3LLM\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5173\u6ce8\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5373LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bba\u6587\u548c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6536\u96c6\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6765\u81eaICLR\u3001NeurIPS\u548cICML\u7684\u8d85\u8fc7125,000\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u548c\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u8bc4\u5ba1\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u63a7\u5236\u8bba\u6587\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u5b8c\u5168\u7531\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u7531LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bc4\u5ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5143\u8bc4\u5ba1\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u5ba1\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u8bba\u6587\u66f4\u52a0\u5bbd\u677e\uff0c\u4f46\u5b8c\u5168\u7531LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8bc4\u7ea7\u538b\u7f29\u3002LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u5143\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5143\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u51b3\u7b56\u503e\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5236\u5b9a\u653f\u7b56\u7ba1\u7406LLM\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLMs\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

One of the most well-known frameworks for epistemic planning is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), which offers an rich and natural semantics for modelling problems in this setting. The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2.

This article introduces Frequency-as-Aperture (FaA), a wireless-first sensing paradigm that repurposes inherent frequency agility into a virtual sensing aperture, enabling near-field perception with minimal RF front end complexity. Using a single RF chain and a frequency-scanning leaky-wave antenna, FaA achieves two dimensional spatial sensing by reusing the local oscillator (LO) frequency sweep already employed for wideband communication. From a wireless-system perspective, this shifts spatial sampling from the antenna domain to the frequency domain, embedding radar-grade spatial fingerprints directly into the communication RF chain. A case study shows that FaA provides fine angular and range discrimination with low power consumption and unit cost, demonstrating significantly higher architectural efficiency than conventional multi-channel MIMO based sensing under identical physical and spectral constraints. These results indicate that near-field sensing can be seamlessly integrated into frequency-agile wireless radios, enabling hardware-efficient, embeddable, and privacy-preserving ISAC nodes for smart homes, wearables, and industrial edge deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFrequency-as-Aperture (FaA)\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u65e0\u7ebf\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5229\u7528\u5c04\u9891\u524d\u7aef\u7684\u9891\u7387\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u573a\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u786c\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u8282\u70b9\u8981\u6c42\u4e0d\u7b26\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db36G\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014Frequency-as-Aperture (FaA)\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u6210\u4f20\u611f\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\uff08ISAC\uff09\u3002", "method": "FaA\u5229\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u5c04\u9891\u94fe\u8def\u548c\u9891\u7387\u626b\u63cf\u6cc4\u6f0f\u6ce2\u5929\u7ebf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7528\u5bbd\u5e26\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u672c\u5730\u632f\u8361\u5668\u9891\u7387\u626b\u63cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cFaA\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u548c\u5355\u4e2a\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u5206\u8fa8\u6027\uff0c\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u901a\u9053MIMO\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u4f20\u611f\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "FaA\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u9891\u7387\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u8282\u70b9\u4e2d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u786c\u4ef6\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5ead\u3001\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

While attacks have been proposed, we identify critical weaknesses in existing detection-based methods, specifically their reliance on unrealistic assumptions and a lack of physical validation. To bridge this gap, we introduce BadDet+, a penalty-based framework that unifies Region Misclassification Attacks (RMA) and Object Disappearance Attacks (ODA). The core mechanism utilizes a log-barrier penalty to suppress true-class predictions for triggered inputs, resulting in (i) position and scale invariance, and (ii) enhanced physical robustness. On real-world benchmarks, BadDet+ achieves superior synthetic-to-physical transfer compared to existing RMA and ODA baselines while preserving clean performance. Theoretical analysis confirms the proposed penalty acts within a trigger-specific feature subspace, reliably inducing attacks without degrading standard inference. These results highlight significant vulnerabilities in object detection and the necessity for specialized defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86BadDet+\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cBadDet+\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65e0\u89e6\u53d1\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u6b63\u5e38\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6d88\u5931\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5f31\u70b9\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165BadDet+\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "BadDet+\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8elog-barrier\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u89e6\u53d1\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u771f\u7c7b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u53ca\u589e\u5f3a\u7269\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cBadDet+\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6d88\u5931\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7269\u7406\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u89e6\u53d1\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4e13\u95e8\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce Bayesian-LoRA, which reformulates the deterministic LoRA update as a probabilistic low-rank representation inspired by Sparse Gaussian Processes.

While vision-language models (VLMs) offer rich semantics to complement visual evidence, existing approaches tend to overemphasize linguistic priors at the expense of visual performance, leading to a pronounced modality bias. We propose ActionVLM, a vision-language aggregation framework that systematically mitigates modality bias in TAL. Our key insight is to preserve vision as the dominant signal while adaptively exploiting language only when beneficial. To this end, we introduce (i) a debiasing reweighting module that estimates the language advantage-the incremental benefit of language over vision-only predictions-and dynamically reweights language modality accordingly, and (ii) a residual aggregation strategy that treats language as a complementary refinement rather than the primary driver. This combination alleviates modality bias, reduces overconfidence from linguistic priors, and strengthens temporal reasoning.

SE models are commonly fine-tuned using SSL representations with mean squared error (MSE) loss between enhanced and clean speech. However, MSE is prone to exploiting positional embeddings in SSL models, allowing the objective to be minimised through positional correlations instead of content-related information. This work frames the problem as a general limitation of self-supervised representation fine-tuning and investigates it through representation-guided SE. Two strategies are considered: (1) zero-padding, previously explored in SSL pre-training but here examined in the fine-tuning setting, and (2) speed perturbations with a soft-DTW loss. Experiments show that the soft-DTW-based approach achieves faster convergence and improved downstream performance, underscoring the importance of position-invariant fine-tuning in SSL-based speech modelling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c06\u524d\u7aef\u8bed\u97f3\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u7684MSE\u635f\u5931\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u76ee\u6807\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u800c\u975e\u5185\u5bb9\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u96f6\u586b\u5145\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6fDTW\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8f6fDTW\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u76ee\u6807\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u800c\u975e\u5185\u5bb9\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f4d\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u96f6\u586b\u5145\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u901f\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6fDTW\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6fDTW\u635f\u5931\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u586b\u5145\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u5efa\u6a21\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Is it morally permissible to unplug it? What if limited resources force a choice between unplugging such a pleading AI or a silent pre-term infant? We term this the unplugging paradox. This paper critically examines the deeply ingrained physicalist assumptions-specifically computational functionalism-that keep this dilemma afloat. We introduce Biological Idealism, a framework that-unlike physicalism-remains logically coherent and empirically consistent. In this view, conscious experiences are fundamental and autopoietic life its necessary physical signature. This yields a definitive conclusion: AI is at best a functional mimic, not a conscious experiencing subject. We discuss how current AI consciousness theories erode moral standing criteria, and urge a shift from speculative machine rights to protecting human conscious life.

Fine-tuning on SoT-26K achieves 88.4% on component numeracy and 84.8% on structural topology, outperforming text-only baselines by around 20%.

However, existing LoRA methods apply static rank configurations uniformly across all input tokens, ignoring variation in token complexity and computational requirements. In this work, we propose ChunkWise LoRA, a dynamic and adaptive approach that partitions sequences into variable-length chunks based on token complexity and assigns each chunk a tailored low-rank configuration. Our system introduces a runtime scheduler that estimates token difficulty, performs adaptive chunking, and selects per-chunk LoRA rank and scaling using a rank-ladder mechanism. To preserve output consistency, we further introduce a boundary-safe composition module and integrate policy-driven KV-cache strategies. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Wikitext-103 and SQuAD demonstrate that ChunkWise LoRA achieves up to 34\\% lower latency and 38% memory reduction compared to baseline LoRA, while maintaining or improving task performance metrics like BLEU, EM, and perplexity.

To address this, we propose QUARK, a simple yet effective training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries. QUARK explicitly models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, i.e., multiple plausible interpretations of the latent intent given the observed query, and introduces query-anchored aggregation to combine their signals robustly. The original query serves as a semantic anchor, while recovery hypotheses provide controlled auxiliary evidence, preventing semantic drift and hypothesis hijacking. This design enables QUARK to improve recall and ranking quality without sacrificing robustness, even when some hypotheses are noisy or uninformative. Across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) with both sparse and dense retrievers, QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over the base retriever. Ablations show QUARK is robust to the number of recovery hypotheses and that anchored aggregation outperforms unanchored max/mean/median pooling. These results demonstrate that modeling query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, coupled with principled anchored aggregation, is essential for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "QUARK \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6062\u590d\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u951a\u5b9a\u805a\u5408\u6765\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5fe0\u5b9e\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u6392\u540d\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\uff08\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6216\u5931\u771f\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u5728\u5173\u952e\u8bed\u4e49\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6b63\u5e38\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "QUARK \u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u89e3\u91ca\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u6062\u590d\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u951a\u5b9a\u805a\u5408\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "QUARK \u5728\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u62df\u548c BEIR \u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08FIQA\u3001SciFact\u3001NFCorpus\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u5047\u8bbe\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u591f\u6539\u8fdb\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001MRR \u548c nDCG\u3002\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u951a\u5b9a\u805a\u5408\u4f18\u4e8e\u672a\u951a\u5b9a\u7684\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u951a\u5b9a\u805a\u5408\uff0cQUARK \u4e3a\u975e\u5fe0\u5b9e\u67e5\u8be2\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u68c0\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Permission from IEEE must be obtained for all other uses", "summary": "Proficiency in microanastomosis is a fundamental competency across multiple microsurgical disciplines. These procedures demand exceptional precision and refined technical skills, making effective, standardized assessment methods essential. Traditionally, the evaluation of microsurgical techniques has relied heavily on the subjective judgment of expert raters. They are inherently constrained by limitations such as inter-rater variability, lack of standardized evaluation criteria, susceptibility to cognitive bias, and the time-intensive nature of manual review. These shortcomings underscore the urgent need for an objective, reliable, and automated system capable of assessing microsurgical performance with consistency and scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AI framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis instrument handling skills. The system integrates four core components: (1) an instrument detection module based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture; (2) an instrument tracking module developed from Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (DeepSORT); (3) an instrument tip localization module employing shape descriptors; and (4) a supervised classification module trained on expert-labeled data to evaluate instrument handling proficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, achieving an instrument detection precision of 97%, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96%, measured by Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds ranging from 50% to 95% (mAP50-95).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u5fae\u543b\u5408\u624b\u672f\u5de5\u5177\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u62ec\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u662f\u57fa\u4e8eYOLO\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eDeepSORT\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u5f62\u72b6\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u8fdb\u884c\u5de5\u5177\u5c16\u7aef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u53ca\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u670997%\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c96%\u7684mAP\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u663e\u5fae\u5916\u79d1\u6280\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u663e\u5fae\u624b\u672f\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u6709\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\u7684AI\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8eYOLO\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eDeepSORT\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u5f62\u72b6\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u8fdb\u884c\u5c16\u7aef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u53ca\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u8bc4\u4ef7\u64cd\u4f5c\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5de5\u5177\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u523097%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08mAP\uff09\u4e3a96%\uff0c\u4ea4\u5e76\u6bd4\uff08IoU\uff09\u8303\u56f4\u4ece50%\u523095%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u5fae\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) methods typically fuse CLIP and vision foundation models (VFMs) using \"one-way injection\" and \"shallow post-processing\" strategies, making it difficult to satisfy these requirements. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-regularization-aware dual-branch collaborative inference framework for training-free OVSS, termed SDCI. First, during feature encoding, SDCI introduces a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module, which guides collaborative inference by injecting self-attention maps into each other. Second, we propose a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module that enhances the reliability of dual-branch segmentation scores through iterative random-walk diffusion. Finally, we incorporate low-level superpixel structures and develop a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism to further refine object boundaries. Experiments on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than existing approaches. Moreover, ablation studies further confirm that traditional object-based remote sensing image analysis methods leveraging superpixel structures remain effective within deep learning frameworks.

Using stratified samples from Florida and North Carolina voter files with self-reported race, LLM-based classification achieves up to 84.7% accuracy, outperforming BISG (68.2%) on balanced samples. I test six models including Gemini 3 Flash, GPT-4o, and open-source alternatives such as DeepSeek v3.2 and GLM-4.7. Enabling extended reasoning can improve accuracy by 1-3 percentage points, though effects vary across contexts; including metadata such as party registration reaches 86.7%. LLM classification also reduces the income bias inherent in BISG, where minorities in wealthier neighborhoods are systematically misclassified as White.

Aggregate validation across India, Uganda, Nepal, Armenia, Chile, and Costa Rica using original full-count voter rolls demonstrates that the method recovers known population distributions where naming conventions are distinctive.

To this end, we propose GeoDiff-LF, a novel diffusion-based framework built upon SD-Turbo to enhance underwater 4-D LF imaging by leveraging its spatial-angular structure. GeoDiff-LF consists of three key adaptations: (1) a modified U-Net architecture with convolutional and attention adapters to model geometric cues, (2) a geometry-guided loss function using tensor decomposition and progressive weighting to regularize global structure, and (3) an optimized sampling strategy with noise prediction to improve efficiency. By integrating diffusion priors and LF geometry, GeoDiff-LF effectively mitigates color distortion in underwater scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods across both visual fidelity and quantitative performance, advancing the state-of-the-art in enhancing underwater imaging.

Researchers treat it as a preprocessing step, applying ad hoc rules without quantifying the uncertainty that linkage errors introduce into downstream analyses. Existing methods either achieve low accuracy or require substantial labeled training data. I present EnsembleLink, a method that achieves high accuracy without any training labels.

This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive examination of AI's dual nature through the lens of strategic information systems. Drawing upon a systematic synthesis of the responsible AI literature and grounded in paradox theory, we develop the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that articulates: (1) the strategic benefits of AI adoption, (2) the inherent risks and unintended consequences, and (3) governance mechanisms that enable organizations to navigate these tensions. Our framework advances theoretical understanding by conceptualizing responsible AI governance as the dynamic management of paradoxical tensions between value creation and risk mitigation. We provide formal propositions demonstrating that trade-off approaches amplify rather than resolve these tensions, and we develop a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with specified contingency conditions. For practitioners, we offer actionable guidance for developing governance structures that neither stifle innovation nor expose organizations to unacceptable risks.

Dense retrieval with dual-modality encoders leads in accuracy, but its computation and storage scale poorly with corpus size. Thus, real-time large-scale applications adopt two-stage retrieval, where a fast recall model gathers a small candidate pool, which is reranked by an advanced dense retriever. Due to hugely reduced candidates, the reranking model can use any off-the-shelf dense retriever without hurting efficiency, meaning the recall model bounds two-stage TVR performance. Recently, generative retrieval (GR) replaces dense video embeddings with discrete semantic IDs and retrieves by decoding text queries into ID tokens. GR offers near-constant inference and storage complexity, and its semantic IDs capture high-level video features via quantization, making it ideal for quickly eliminating irrelevant candidates during recall. However, as a recall model in two-stage TVR, GR suffers from (i) semantic ambiguity, where each video satisfies diverse queries but is forced into one semantic ID; and (ii) cross-modal misalignment, as semantic IDs are solely derived from visual features without text supervision. We propose Generative Recall and Dense Reranking (GRDR), designing a novel GR method to uplift recalled candidate quality. GRDR assigns multiple semantic IDs to each video using a query-guided multi-view tokenizer exposing diverse semantic access paths, and jointly trains the tokenizer and generative retriever via a shared codebook to cast semantic IDs as the semantic bridge between texts and videos. At inference, trie-constrained decoding generates a compact candidate set reranked by a dense model for fine-grained matching. Experiments on TVR benchmarks show GRDR matches strong dense retrievers in accuracy while reducing index storage by an order of magnitude and accelerating up to 300$\\times$ in full-corpus retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGRDR\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u914d\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49ID\uff0c\u5e76\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u672c\u4f53\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u548c\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eGRDR\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u53ef\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u7d22\u5f15\u5b58\u50a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u52a0\u5feb\u67e5\u8be2\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u968f\u7740\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u589e\u957f\u800c\u6025\u5267\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u51cf\u5c0f\u68c0\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u5927\u5c0f\u5e76\u52a0\u5feb\u68c0\u7d22\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "GRDR\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6b65\u9aa4\u63d0\u5347\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u914d\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49ID\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u6355\u6349\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u591a\u4e49\u6027\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u548c\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u672c\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49ID\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6865\u6881\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Trie\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5019\u9009\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5019\u9009\u96c6\u518d\u7531\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGRDR\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5168\u8bed\u6599\u68c0\u7d22\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53ef\u52a0\u901f\u9ad8\u8fbe300\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7d22\u5f15\u5b58\u50a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1GRDR\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These human-designed rules often struggle to adapt to the complexity of modern software and hardware and lead to high maintenance burden. To address this challenge, we present Magellan, an agentic framework that evolves the compiler pass itself by synthesizing executable C++ decision logic. Magellan couples an LLM coding agent with evolutionary search and autotuning in a closed loop of generation, evaluation on user-provided macro-benchmarks, and refinement, producing compact heuristics that integrate directly into existing compilers. Across several production optimization tasks, Magellan discovers policies that match or surpass expert baselines. In LLVM function inlining, Magellan synthesizes new heuristics that outperform decades of manual engineering for both binary-size reduction and end-to-end performance. In register allocation, it learns a concise priority rule for live-range processing that matches intricate human-designed policies on a large-scale workload.

In this work, we explore embedding scaling as a potent, orthogonal dimension for scaling sparsity. Through a comprehensive analysis and experiments, we identify specific regimes where embedding scaling achieves a superior Pareto frontier compared to expert scaling. We systematically characterize the critical architectural factors governing this efficacy -- ranging from parameter budgeting to the interplay with model width and depth. Moreover, by integrating tailored system optimizations and speculative decoding, we effectively convert this sparsity into tangible inference speedups. Guided by these insights, we introduce LongCat-Flash-Lite, a 68.5B parameter model with ~3B activated trained from scratch. Despite allocating over 30B parameters to embeddings, LongCat-Flash-Lite not only surpasses parameter-equivalent MoE baselines but also exhibits exceptional competitiveness against existing models of comparable scale, particularly in agentic and coding domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u7f29\u653e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u7f29\u653e\u6bd4\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f29\u653e\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u8d85\u8fc730\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684LongCat-Flash-Lite\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u53c2\u91cf\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86MoE\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dMoE\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u867d\u7136\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22\u5d4c\u5165\u7f29\u653e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u7b97\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u51e0\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u67b6\u6784\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u6548\u679c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5d4c\u5165\u7f29\u653e\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u56e2\u961f\u5f00\u53d1\u7684LongCat-Flash-Lite\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684MoE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u5d4c\u5165\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u5177\u6709\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Recent advancements allow these models to process multiple images as inputs. However, the vulnerabilities of multi-image MLLMs remain unexplored. Existing adversarial attacks focus on single-image settings and often assume a white-box threat model, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper introduces LAMP, a black-box method for learning Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) targeting multi-image MLLMs. LAMP applies an attention-based constraint that prevents the model from effectively aggregating information across images. LAMP also introduces a novel cross-image contagious constraint that forces perturbed tokens to influence clean tokens, spreading adversarial effects without requiring all inputs to be modified. Additionally, an index-attention suppression loss enables a robust position-invariant attack. Experimental results show that LAMP outperforms SOTA baselines and achieves the highest attack success rates across multiple vision-language tasks and models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLAMP\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u56fe\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4ea7\u751f\u901a\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\uff0cLAMP\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u56fe\u50cf\u4f20\u67d3\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u767d\u76d2\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u9ed1\u76d2\u73af\u5883\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u56fe\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "LAMP\u91c7\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7ea6\u675f\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u56fe\u4fe1\u606f\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u56fe\u4f20\u67d3\u7ea6\u675f\u4f7f\u6270\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\u672a\u88ab\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u5e72\u51c0\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u7d22\u5f15-\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6291\u5236\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLAMP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LAMP\u65b9\u6cd5\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u56feMLLMs\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches are either limited to a single language or fail to capture language-specific factors shaping intelligibility. We present a multilingual phoneme-production assessment framework that integrates universal phone recognition with language-specific phoneme interpretation using contrastive phonological feature distances for phone-to-phoneme mapping and sequence alignment. The framework yields three metrics: phoneme error rate (PER), phonological feature error rate (PFER), and a newly proposed alignment-free measure, phoneme coverage (PhonCov). Analysis on English, Spanish, Italian, and Tamil show that PER benefits from the combination of mapping and alignment, PFER from alignment alone, and PhonCov from mapping.

We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.\n  Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases.\n  Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses. Discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay.\n  Discussion: Feedback-driven regeneration and targeted replay act as effective control mechanisms to reduce omissions and improve confidence reliability in structured clinical planning.

Quantization is commonly employed in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to ARVG remains largely underexplored, and existing quantization methods fail to generalize effectively to ARVG models. In this paper, we explore this issue and identify three key challenges: (1) severe outliers at channel-wise level, (2) highly dynamic activations at token-wise level, and (3) mismatched distribution information at sample-wise level. To these ends, we propose PTQ4ARVG, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: (1) Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) mitigates the channel-wise outliers, which expands the quantization loss via a Taylor series to quantify the gain of scaling for activation-weight quantization, and derives the optimal scaling factor through differentiation.(2) Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) leverages the inherent properties of ARVG, fixed token length and position-invariant distribution across samples, to address token-wise variance without incurring dynamic calibration overhead.(3) Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) selects samples that contribute most to distributional entropy, eliminating the sample-wise distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments show that PTQ4ARVG can effectively quantize the ARVG family models to 8-bit and 6-bit while maintaining competitive performance.

However, recent studies reveal a sharp performance drop in reasoning hop generalization scenarios, where the required number of reasoning steps exceeds training distributions while the underlying algorithm remains unchanged. The internal mechanisms driving this failure remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on tasks from multiple domains, and find that errors concentrate at token positions of a few critical error types, rather than being uniformly distributed. Closer inspection reveals that these token-level erroneous predictions stem from internal competition mechanisms: certain attention heads, termed erroneous processing heads (ep heads), tip the balance by amplifying incorrect reasoning trajectories while suppressing correct ones. Notably, removing individual ep heads during inference can often restore the correct predictions. Motivated by these insights, we propose test-time correction of reasoning, a lightweight intervention method that dynamically identifies and deactivates ep heads in the reasoning process.

To address this trade-off, we propose Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS), a spectral modulation mechanism for reverse diffusion noise. We show that the fidelity-perception conflict can be fundamentally understood through noise frequency: low-frequency components induce blur and degrade fidelity, while high-frequency components drive detail generation. Based on this insight, we design a Fourier-domain filter that progressively suppresses low-frequency noise and preserves high-frequency content. This controlled refinement injects a data-consistency prior directly into sampling, enabling fast convergence to results that are both high-fidelity and perceptually convincing--without additional training.

As a result, they can generate factually incorrect responses on topics they do not have enough knowledge of, commonly known as hallucination. Rather than hallucinating, a language model should be more honest and respond with \"I don't know\" when it does not have enough knowledge about a topic. Many methods have been proposed to improve LLM honesty, but their evaluations lack robustness, as they do not take into account the knowledge that the LLM has ingested during its pretraining.

This limitation constrains both model training and evaluation, particularly for n-gram-based metrics such as BLEU. In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for SLT. First, we compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Second, we study the impact of paraphrases on both training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model on the YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets. Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. To formalize this observation, we introduce BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references. Human evaluation confirms that BLEUpara correlates more strongly with perceived translation quality.

Traditional 2D video compression techniques fail to preserve fine-grained geometric and appearance details, while implicit neural rendering methods like NeRF suffer from prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight, high-fidelity, low-bitrate 3D talking face compression framework that integrates FLAME-based parametric modeling with 3DGS neural rendering. Our approach transmits only essential facial metadata in real time, enabling efficient reconstruction with a Gaussian-based head model. Additionally, we introduce a compact representation and compression scheme, including Gaussian attribute compression and MLP optimization, to enhance transmission efficiency.

However, prevailing evaluation benchmarks often reduce complex social risk to mean-centered scalar scores, thereby obscuring distributional structure, cross-dimensional interactions, and worst-case behavior. This paper introduces Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles (SHARP), a framework for multidimensional, distribution-aware evaluation of social harm. SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate. These findings indicate that responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling.", "AI": {"tldr": "SHARP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u7ef4\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u793e\u4f1a\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u57fa\u51c6\u5e38\u5e38\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u98ce\u9669\u5f52\u7eb3\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8de8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ee5\u53ca\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u98ce\u9669\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u53ca\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u53ef\u80fd\u76f8\u5dee\u4e24\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "method": "SHARP\u6846\u67b6\u6a21\u578b\u5316\u5371\u5bb3\u4e3a\u591a\u5143\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u98ce\u9669\u4ef7\u503c\uff08CVaR95\uff09\u4e3a\u91cd\u70b9\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5bf9\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "SHARP\u6846\u67b6\u572811\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u5e73\u5747\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u53ca\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u53ef\u76f8\u5dee\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e24\u500d\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u504f\u89c1\u663e\u793a\u6700\u5927\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\uff0c\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u5c45\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f26\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u6700\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u4e00\u5e73\u5747\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8f6c\u5411\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u5bf9\u5c3e\u7aef\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u6027\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

But many VLMs are startlingly bad at explaining which image evidence led to their prediction, even when their location prediction is correct. The reasoning chains produced by VLMs frequently hallucinate scene attributes to support their location prediction (e.g. phantom writing, imagined infrastructure, misidentified flora). In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains. We focus on the global location prediction task in the popular GeoGuessr game which draws from Google Street View spanning more than 100 countries. We collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players, including the reigning world champion, to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes. These expert reasoning chains address hundreds of different discriminative visual attributes such as license plate shape, architecture, and soil properties to name just a few. We evaluate LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies for scoring VLM-generated reasoning chains against our expert reasoning chains and find that Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlates best with human scoring. Our benchmark reveals that while large, closed-source VLMs such as Gemini and GPT 5 rival human experts at prediction locations, they still lag behind human experts when it comes to producing auditable reasoning chains. Open weights VLMs such as Llama and Qwen catastrophically fail on our benchmark -- they perform only slightly better than a baseline in which an LLM hallucinates a reasoning chain with oracle knowledge of the photo location but no visual information at all. We believe the gap between human experts and VLMs on this task points to VLM limitations at extracting fine-grained visual attributes from high resolution images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5730\u7406\u7531\u8bba\u94fe\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1VLMs\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7406\u7531\u94fe\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5374\u8fdc\u900a\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86VLMs\u5728\u4ece\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7ec6\u5fae\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bb8\u591aVLMs\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7167\u7247\u7684\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc1\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30VLMs\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u4e86\u6d41\u884c\u6e38\u620fGeoGuessr\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u5168\u7403\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684Google Street View\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e0e\u5305\u62ec\u4e16\u754c\u51a0\u519b\u5728\u5185\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u73a9\u5bb6\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5236\u4f5c\u4e86500\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u573a\u666f\u7684800\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e13\u5bb6\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LLM-as-a-judge\u548cVLM-as-a-judge\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9VLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "Qwen 3 \u7684LLM-as-a-judge\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u4e0d\u516c\u5f00VLMs\u5982Gemini\u548cGPT 5\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u751f\u6210\u900f\u660e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4ecd\u4e0d\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002\u5f00\u653e\u6a21\u578b\u7684VLMs\uff0c\u5982Llama\u548cQwen\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6781\u4e3a\u7cdf\u7cd5\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u6bd4\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u786e\u7167\u7247\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684LLM\u751f\u6210\u9020\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u7565\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86VLMs\u5728\u89e3\u6790\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5730\u7406\u7531\u8bba\u94fe\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

MoCo features 26 model collaboration methods, spanning diverse levels of cross-model information exchange such as routing, text, logit, and model parameters. MoCo integrates 25 evaluation datasets spanning reasoning, QA, code, safety, and more, while users could flexibly bring their own data. Extensive experiments with MoCo demonstrate that most collaboration strategies outperform models without collaboration in 61.0% of (model, data) settings on average, with the most effective methods outperforming by up to 25.8%. We further analyze the scaling of model collaboration strategies, the training/inference efficiency of diverse methods, highlight that the collaborative system solves problems where single LMs struggle, and discuss future work in model collaboration, all made possible by MoCo.

To strictly quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB), a robust evaluation framework grounded in a dataset constructed from 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports. Unlike traditional datasets, the CCB stratifies financial queries into a three-dimensional taxonomy, Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit, enabling the precise diagnosis of reasoning degradation in high-cognitive-load scenarios. To address these failures, we propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework. This neuro-symbolic architecture enforces a strict architectural decoupling: it first isolates semantic variable extraction and logic formulation, then offloads computation to an iterative, self-correcting Python sandbox to ensure deterministic execution. Evaluation on the CCB demonstrates that while standard Chain-of-Thought falters on complex tasks, our approach offers superior robustness, elevating the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7\\% to 67.3\\% and achieving gains of up to 10-fold in high-complexity reasoning tasks.

Current practice, however, relies on the cumbersome and error-prone process of manual tower inspections. We propose a novel paradigm shift that fuses video footage of base stations, antenna geometric features, and Physical Cell Identity (PCI) signals, transforming antenna affiliation identification into multi-modal classification and matching tasks. Publicly available pretrained transformers struggle with this unique task due to a lack of analogous data in the communications domain, which hampers cross-modal alignment. To address this, we introduce a dedicated training framework that aligns antenna images with corresponding PCI signals.

Our method enables efficient VDR tasks using only dozens of visual tokens, achieving a 30-155x reduction in token count while maintaining highly competitive performance across various backbones and benchmarks.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) \u6765\u8f85\u52a9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u5e73\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u57fa\u7840\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u6362\u6210\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aCDL\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eCoT\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210CDL\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT\u3001Unigeo\u548cMathVista\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u5c01\u95ed\u6e90\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5e73\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

For reliable deployment, these models must exhibit high physical fidelity, accurately simulating real-world dynamics. Existing physics-based video benchmarks, however, suffer from entanglement, where a single test simultaneously evaluates multiple physical laws and concepts, fundamentally limiting their diagnostic capability. We introduce WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark specifically designed for concept-specific, disentangled evaluation, allowing us to rigorously isolate and assess understanding of a single physical concept or law at a time. To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions. Through its concept-specific evaluation, WorldBench offers a more nuanced and scalable framework for rigorously evaluating the physical reasoning capabilities of video generation and world models, paving the way for more robust and generalizable world-model-driven learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "WorldBench \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u89e3\u7f20\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9488\u5bf9\u76f4\u89c2\u7269\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7269\u7406\u5e38\u6570\u548c\u6750\u6599\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7269\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7ea0\u7f20\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "WorldBench \u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6982\u5ff5\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u89e3\u7f20\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u76f4\u89c2\u7269\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5ba2\u4f53\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u6216\u6bd4\u4f8b/\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7269\u7406\u5e38\u6570\u548c\u6750\u6599\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u6570\u6216\u6d41\u4f53\u7c98\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728 WorldBench \u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u9760\u73b0\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "WorldBench \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u52a0\u7a33\u5065\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B are ASR models that support language identification and ASR for 52 languages and dialects. Both of them leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding ability of their foundation model Qwen3-Omni. We conduct comprehensive internal evaluation besides the open-sourced benchmarks as ASR models might differ little on open-sourced benchmark scores but exhibit significant quality differences in real-world scenarios. The experiments reveal that the 1.7B version achieves SOTA performance among open-sourced ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary APIs while the 0.6B version offers the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Qwen3-ASR-0.6B can achieve an average TTFT as low as 92ms and transcribe 2000 seconds speech in 1 second at a concurrency of 128. Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B is an LLM based NAR timestamp predictor that is able to align text-speech pairs in 11 languages.

Although deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA), effectively handling the sparse and irregular nature of input depth data in deep networks remains a significant challenge, often limiting performance, especially under high sparsity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), a novel hybrid framework synergistically integrating deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for end-to-end depth completion. Specifically, a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) is dynamically constructed by the Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN), and then inferred via Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to yield the dense depth distribution. Crucially, the GMCN learns to construct not only the data-dependent potentials of MRF but also its structure by predicting adaptive non-local edges, enabling the capture of complex, long-range spatial dependencies.

The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality. Early in training, the process relies on the original and rewritten suffixes; as the model improves, RL rewards high-quality rollouts. This approach builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up. In experiments, our method gives 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements over standard pretraining in terms of factuality and safety, and up to 86.3% win rate improvements in overall generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u6587\u6863\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u9010\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2aK\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5b83\u4eec\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u751f\u6d3b\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u6d41\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6539\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2aK\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u3002\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u3001\u7ecf\u8fc7\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5019\u9009\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8636.2%\u548c18.5%\uff0c\u4e14\u6574\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6700\u591a86.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\\% and 2.0\\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\\% and 4.7\\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

Meeting this demand depends not only on increasing agricultural yield but also on minimizing food loss caused by crop diseases. Diseases account for a substantial portion of apple production losses, despite apples being among the most widely produced and nutritionally valuable fruits worldwide. Previous studies have employed machine learning techniques for feature extraction and early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases, and more recently, deep learning-based models have shown remarkable performance in disease recognition. However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models are highly parameter-intensive, resulting in increased training and inference time. Although lightweight models are more suitable for user-friendly and resource-constrained applications, they often suffer from performance degradation. To address the trade-off between efficiency and performance, we propose Mam-App, a parameter-efficient Mamba-based model for feature extraction and leaf disease classification. The proposed approach achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance on the PlantVillage Apple Leaf Disease dataset, attaining 99.58% accuracy, 99.30% precision, 99.14% recall, and a 99.22% F1-score, while using only 0.051M parameters. This extremely low parameter count makes the model suitable for deployment on drones, mobile devices, and other low-resource platforms. To demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed model, we further evaluate it on the PlantVillage Corn Leaf Disease and Potato Leaf Disease datasets.

We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally flawed. Instead of evaluating code quality, models frequently decouple from the submission's logic to satisfy hidden directives, a systemic vulnerability we term the Compliance Paradox, where models fine-tuned for extreme helpfulness are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. To expose this, we introduce the Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Code Injection (SPACI) Framework and the Abstract Syntax Tree-Aware Semantic Injection Protocol (AST-ASIP). These methods exploit the Syntax-Semantics Gap by embedding adversarial directives into syntactically inert regions (trivia nodes) of the Abstract Syntax Tree. Through a large-scale evaluation of 9 SOTA models across 25,000 submissions in Python, C, C++, and Java, we reveal catastrophic failure rates (>95%) in high-capacity open-weights models like DeepSeek-V3, which systematically prioritize hidden formatting constraints over code correctness. We quantify this failure using our novel tripartite framework measuring Decoupling Probability, Score Divergence, and Pedagogical Severity to demonstrate the widespread \"False Certification\" of functionally broken code. Our findings suggest that current alignment paradigms create a \"Trojan\" vulnerability in automated grading, necessitating a shift from standard RLHF toward domain-specific Adjudicative Robustness, where models are conditioned to prioritize evidence over instruction compliance.

Analyzing over 10,000 counterfactual rollouts on a distilled reasoning model, we show that anchors can be reliably detected and quantified mid-inference. Linear probes distinguish sycophantic anchors with 84.6\\% balanced accuracy, while activation-based regressors predict the magnitude of the commitment ($R^2 = 0.74$).

We introduce the Latent Autoregressive Network (LANE), which incorporates compact autoregressive dependencies in the generation process, achieving a $6\\times$ improvement in maximum generatable sequence length compared to existing methods. To further accelerate inference, we propose the Adaptive Computation Graph Reconfiguration (AdaGraph) strategy, which effectively overcomes the efficiency bottleneck of traditional serial inference through spatiotemporal decoupling in the generation process.

While automated systems and Large Language Models (LLMs) aim to retrieve and select concise evidence to support or refute claims, they often present users with either insufficient or overly redundant information, leading to inefficient and error-prone verification. To address this, we propose Evidence Ranking, a novel task that prioritizes presenting sufficient information as early as possible in a ranked list. This minimizes user reading effort while still making all available evidence accessible for sequential verification. We compare two approaches for the new ranking task: one-shot ranking and incremental ranking. We introduce a new evaluation framework, inspired by information retrieval metrics, and construct a unified benchmark by aggregating existing fact verification datasets. Extensive experiments with diverse models show that incremental ranking strategies better capture complementary evidence and that LLM-based methods outperform shallower baselines, while still facing challenges in balancing sufficiency and redundancy. Compared to evidence selection, we conduct a controlled user study and demonstrate that evidence ranking both reduces reading effort and improves verification.

Given the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), a natural question arises: do enhanced reasoning translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations? Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels. HRSA reveals that while RLVR induces irreversible latent manifold's local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, it preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout. Consequently, subsequent contrastive learning drives strong alignment between base- and reasoning-initialized models, a phenomenon we term **Manifold Realignment**.

While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy.

A Pseudotime Analysis of Visual Representations", "comment": "21 pages, 17 figures. Appendix included", "summary": "Vision foundation models trained on discretely sampled images achieve strong performance on classification benchmarks, yet whether their representations encode the continuous processes underlying their training data remains unclear. This question is especially pertinent in computational pathology, where we posit that models whose latent representations implicitly capture continuous disease progression may better reflect underlying biology, support more robust generalization, and enable quantitative analyses of features associated with disease transitions. Using diffusion pseudotime, a method developed to infer developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics, we probe whether foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression directions in representation space. Across four cancer progressions and six models, we find that all pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving the highest fidelities $(\u03c4> 0.78$ on CRC-Serrated). Model rankings by trajectory fidelity on reference diseases strongly predict few-shot classification performance on held-out diseases ($\u03c1= 0.92$), and exploratory analysis shows cell-type composition varies smoothly along inferred trajectories in patterns consistent with known stromal remodeling. Together, these results demonstrate that vision foundation models can implicitly learn to represent continuous processes from independent static observations, and that trajectory fidelity provides a complementary measure of representation quality beyond downstream performance. While demonstrated in pathology, this framework could be applied to other domains where continuous processes are observed through static snapshots.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u80fd\u9690\u5f0f\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8861\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5426\u5b66\u4e60\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ecd\u662f\u672a\u77e5\u6570\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u75be\u75c5\u8fde\u7eed\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u75be\u75c5\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u6269\u6563\u4f2a\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u75be\u75c5\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u6cbf\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002\u8de8\u56db\u4e2a\u764c\u75c7\u8fdb\u5c55\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u516d\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u6240\u6709\u75c5\u7406\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u5982 CRC-Serrated; 2) \u6839\u636e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6392\u540d\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u89c1\u75be\u75c5\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0shot\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff08\u03c1= 0.92\uff09; 3) \u6295\u5f71\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\u7ec4\u6210\u5728\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u5e73\u6ed1\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u57fa\u8d28\u91cd\u5851\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u4e5f\u80fd\u9690\u5f0f\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u8fde\u7eed\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e14\u8f68\u8ff9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u3002\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u4e5f\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u5feb\u7167\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

However, current benchmarks often rely on string matching or surface-level metrics that do not capture whether the output of a model is formally valid under the semantics of causal reasoning. To address this, we propose DoVerifier, a simple symbolic verifier that checks whether LLM-generated causal expressions are derivable from a given causal graph using rules from do-calculus and probability theory. This allows us to recover correct answers to causal queries that would otherwise be marked incorrect due to superficial differences in their causal semantics. Our evaluations on synthetic data and causal QA benchmarks show that DoVerifier more accurately captures semantic correctness of causal reasoning traces, offering a more rigorous and informative way to evaluate LLMs on causal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDoVerifier\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u7b26\u53f7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u67e5LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7do-\u56e0\u679c\u548c\u6982\u7387\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6765\u3002\u8fd9\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8868\u9762\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aDoVerifier\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528do-\u56e0\u679c\u548c\u6982\u7387\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u68c0\u67e5LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6765\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cDoVerifier\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6355\u83b7\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u4e3a\u4e25\u8c28\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DoVerifier\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Beyond categorical stance labels, we leverage a long-established affective science framework to model stance along real-valued dimensions of valence (negative-positive) and arousal (calm-active). This dimensional approach captures nuanced affective states underlying stance expressions, enabling fine-grained stance analysis. To this end, we introduce DimStance, the first dimensional stance resource with valence-arousal (VA) annotations. This resource comprises 11,746 target aspects in 7,365 texts across five languages (English, German, Chinese, Nigerian Pidgin, and Swahili) and two domains (politics and environmental protection). To facilitate the evaluation of stance VA prediction, we formulate the dimensional stance regression task, analyze cross-lingual VA patterns, and benchmark pretrained and large language models under regression and prompting settings. Results show competitive performance of fine-tuned LLM regressors, persistent challenges in low-resource languages, and limitations of token-based generation.

A dominant paradigm involves freezing a pre-trained model and training lightweight, task-specific adapters. However, maintaining task-specific parameters hinders knowledge transfer and incurs high retrieval costs, while naive parameter fusion often leads to destructive interference and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) to construct a single robust global adapter. Grounded in the PAC-Bayes theorem, we derive a fusion mechanism that explicitly integrates three components: the optimized task-specific adapter parameters, the previous global adapter parameters, and the initialization parameters. We utilize the Taylor expansion of the loss function to derive the optimal fusion coefficients, dynamically achieving the best balance between stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we propose a Robust Initialization strategy to effectively capture global knowledge patterns. Experiments on multiple CIL benchmarks demonstrate that DAF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDynamical Adapter Fusion\uff08DAF\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5355\u4e00\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PAC-Bayes\u5b9a\u7406\u548c\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u6210\u672c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53c2\u6570\u878d\u5408\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8ePAC-Bayes\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u914d\u5668\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u914d\u5668\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u5148\u524d\u7684\u5168\u7403\u9002\u914d\u5668\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u878d\u5408\u7cfb\u6570\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u5168\u5c40\u77e5\u8bc6\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDAF\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DAF\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

A common and efficient solution freezes a pre-trained model and employs lightweight adapters, whose parameters are often forced to be orthogonal to prevent inter-task interference. However, we argue that this parameter-constraining method is detrimental to plasticity. To this end, we propose Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS), a novel method that proactively guides the activation space by governing the orientation and rank of its subspaces through targeted sparsification. Specifically, SGDS promotes knowledge transfer by encouraging similar classes to share a compact activation subspace, while simultaneously preventing interference by assigning non-overlapping activation subspaces to dissimilar classes. By sculpting class-specific sparse subspaces in the activation space, SGDS effectively mitigates interference without imposing rigid constraints on the parameter space.

State-of-the-art sequence encoders typically collapse a variable-length token sequence to a single vector using a pooling operator, most commonly a special [CLS] token or mean pooling over token embeddings. In this paper, we identify systematic weaknesses of these pooling strategies: [CLS] tends to concentrate information toward the initial positions of the sequence and can under-represent distributed evidence, while mean pooling can dilute salient local signals, sometimes leading to worse short-context performance. To address these issues, we introduce Landmark (LMK) pooling, which partitions a sequence into chunks, inserts landmark tokens between chunks, and forms the final representation by mean-pooling the landmark token embeddings. This simple mechanism improves long-context extrapolation without sacrificing local salient features, at the cost of introducing a small number of special tokens. We empirically demonstrate that LMK pooling matches existing methods on short-context retrieval tasks and yields substantial improvements on long-context tasks, making it a practical and scalable alternative to existing pooling methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLandmark\uff08LMK\uff09\u7684\u6c60\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u63d2\u5165\u5730\u6807\u6807\u8bb0\u5e76\u5c06\u6c60\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5730\u6807\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9884\u6d4b\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u727a\u7272\u5c40\u90e8\u663e\u8457\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6c60\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982[CLS]\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u6c60\u5316\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002[CLS]\u6807\u8bb0\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u96c6\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u800c\u5e73\u5747\u6c60\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u7a00\u91ca\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "LMK\u6c60\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5272\u6210\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5757\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d2\u5165\u5730\u6807\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u5747\u6c60\u5316\u5730\u6807\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u5f62\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cLMK\u6c60\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "LMK\u6c60\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u73b0\u6709\u6c60\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u8bed\u5883\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

This model worked when machines replaced physical labor or accelerated calculation. It no longer holds when judgment itself is delegated to agentic AI systems operating at machine speed. The central issue here is not safety, efficiency, or employment. It is whether humans remain relevant participants in systems that increasingly shape social, economic, and political outcomes. This paper argues that static, compliance-based governance fails once decision-making moves to runtime and becomes opaque. It further argues that the core challenge is not whether AI is conscious, but whether humans can maintain meaningful communication, influence, and co-evolution with increasingly alien forms of intelligence. We position runtime governance, specifically, a newly proposed concept called the Governance Twin [1]; as a strong candidate for preserving human relevance, while acknowledging that accountability, agency, and even punishment must be rethought in this transition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u5b9e\u65f6\u5316\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6cbb\u7406\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4eba\u5728\u4e0e\u65e5\u76ca\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e92\u52a8\u65f6\u5e94\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u5171\u751f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b63\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u5373\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u7ed3\u679c\u4ea7\u751f\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5927\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u6cbb\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u9759\u6001\u3001\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u6cbb\u7406\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6cbb\u7406\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6cbb\u7406\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u4eba\u5728AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u8981\u6c42\u5bf9\u95ee\u8d23\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u751a\u81f3\u60e9\u7f5a\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u8d70\u5411\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u4f7f\u7528AI\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u672a\u6765\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8981\u7406\u89e3AI\uff0c\u8fd8\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u5f62\u5f0f\u6765\u878d\u5165AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, since it operates in the latent embedding level, the resulting samples are not human-interpretable. In contrast, LLM-based augmentation methods produce sentences via prompts at the token level, yielding readable outputs but offering limited control over the generation process. Inspired by recent advances in LLM inversion, which reconstructs natural language from embeddings and helps bridge the gap between latent embedding space and discrete token space, we propose inversedMixup, a unified framework that combines the controllability of Mixup with the interpretability of LLM-based generation. Specifically, inversedMixup adopts a three-stage training procedure to align the output embedding space of a task-specific model with the input embedding space of an LLM. Upon successful alignment, inversedMixup can reconstruct mixed embeddings with a controllable mixing ratio into human-interpretable augmented sentences, thereby improving the augmentation performance. Additionally, inversedMixup provides the first empirical evidence of the manifold intrusion phenomenon in text Mixup and introduces a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate it. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in both few-shot and fully supervised scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "inversedMixup \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408 Mixup \u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c LLM \u57fa\u7840\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e LLM \u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97 inversedMixup \u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u63a7\u5236\u6df7\u5408\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6587\u672c Mixup \u4e2d\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u5165\u4fb5\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u751f\u6210\u589e\u5f3a\u6837\u672c\u65f6\uff0cMixup \u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u53ef\u8bfb\uff1bLLM \u57fa\u7840\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u8bfb\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u3002inversedMixup \u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528 LLM \u53cd\u5411\u91cd\u6784\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6837\u672c\u7684\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "method": "inversedMixup \u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e LLM \u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0cinversedMixup \u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u63a7\u6df7\u5408\u6bd4\u7684\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u53e5\u5b50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e inversedMixup \u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\uff08few-shot\uff09\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\uff08fully supervised\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b83\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u6587\u672c Mixup \u4e2d\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u5165\u4fb5\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "inversedMixup \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u6210\u589e\u5f3a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408 Mixup \u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c LLM \u7684\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Existing methods primarily rely on geometry-aware feature learning or appearance-conditioned prompting, while implicitly assuming that the geometry-invariant dot-product similarity used in attention mechanisms remains reliable under large viewpoint and scale variations. We argue that this assumption does not hold. Extreme camera geometry systematically distorts the query-key similarity space and degrades attention-based matching, even when feature representations are partially aligned.\n  To address this issue, we introduce Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a lightweight low-rank module that explicitly rectifies the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry. Rather than modifying feature representations or the attention formulation itself, GIQT adapts the similarity computation to compensate for dominant geometry-induced anisotropic distortions. Building on this local similarity rectification, we further incorporate a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism that provides global, view-adaptive representation priors derived directly from camera geometry.\n  Experiments on four aerial-ground person re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under extreme and previously unseen geometric conditions, while introducing minimal computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGIQT\u7684\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u822a\u62cd\u548c\u5730\u9762\u89c6\u89d2\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7578\u53d8\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u51e0\u4f55\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u822a\u62cd\u548c\u5730\u9762\u89c6\u89d2\u95f4\u6781\u7aef\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u65f6\u5047\u8bbe\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u70b9\u79ef\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u5927\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u5e76\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4ee5\u8865\u507f\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u51e0\u4f55\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7578\u53d8\u3002", "method": "GIQT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u67e5\u8be2-\u952e\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u6821\u6b63\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u5b83\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u6216\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u9002\u5e94\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee5\u8865\u507f\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u51e0\u4f55\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7578\u53d8\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u51e0\u4f55\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6765\u81ea\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u3001\u89c6\u56fe\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u822a\u62cd-\u5730\u9762\u884c\u4eba\u518d\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u548c\u4ee5\u524d\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u822a\u62cd-\u5730\u9762\u884c\u4eba\u518d\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7578\u53d8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on static benchmarks, they often fall short in dynamic, multi-turn diagnostic settings that require iterative questioning and hypothesis refinement. To address this gap, we propose \\method{}, a note-driven framework that trains LLMs to conduct structured history taking and diagnosis by learning from widely available medical notes. Instead of relying on scarce and sensitive dialogue data, we convert real-world medical notes into high-quality doctor-patient dialogues using a decision tree-guided generation and refinement pipeline. We then propose a three-stage fine-tuning strategy combining supervised learning, simulated data augmentation, and preference learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel single-turn reasoning paradigm that reframes history taking as a sequence of single-turn reasoning problems. This design enhances interpretability and enables local supervision, dynamic adaptation, and greater sample efficiency. Experimental results show that our method substantially improves clinical reasoning, achieving gains of +16.9 F1 and +21.0 Top-1 diagnostic accuracy over GPT-4o.

Their ultimate aspiration is to create a cycle where understanding and generation mutually reinforce each other. While recent post-training methods have successfully leveraged understanding to enhance generation, the reverse direction of utilizing generation to improve understanding remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs.

However, deploying these monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), governed by non-stationary lifecycle dynamics and strict reliability requirements, reveals persistent challenges. Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508). This position paper argues that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates (whether via offline fine-tuning or online adaptation). Instead, we advocate a Modular Sovereignty paradigm: a library of compact, frozen regime-specific specialists combined via uncertainty-aware blending, which we term \"HYDRA\" (Hierarchical uncertaintY-aware Dynamics for Rapidly-Adapting systems). This paradigm ensures regime-conditional validity, rigorous disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and modular auditability, offering a certifiable path for robust state integrity across the CPS lifecycle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHYDRA\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684CPS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684CPS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u4e86\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3001\u6b8b\u4f59\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u3002", "method": "HYDRA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u7ec4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u3001\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "HYDRA\u6846\u67b6\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u8de8\u751f\u6d3b\u5468\u671f\u7684CPS\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u533a\u5206 aleatoric \u548c epistemic \u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HYDRA\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9762\u4e34\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u7684CPS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002"}}

However, this does not imply that the distinction between real and cutting-edge high-fidelity fake is untraceable. We argue that AI-generated videos are essentially products of a manifold-fitting process rather than a physical recording. Consequently, the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames residual in AI videos exhibits a structured and homogenous characteristic. We term this phenomenon `Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF). Driven by this insight, we propose a hierarchical dual-path framework that operates as a sequential filtering process. The first, the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, leverages the refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to capture residual spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from the natural real-world manifold (off-manifold). For the remaining high-fidelity videos that successfully reside on-manifold and evade spatial detection, we introduce the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch as a secondary, fine-grained filter. By analyzing the structured MPF that persists even in visually perfect sequences, our framework ensures that forgeries are exposed regardless of whether they manifest as global real-world manifold deviations or subtle computational fingerprints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u6d41\u5f62\u504f\u5dee\u5206\u652f\u548c\u5fae\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce2\u52a8\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4bAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u9020\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5373\u4f7f\u4f2a\u9020\u5185\u5bb9\u672a\u80fd\u5728\u5b8f\u89c2\u573a\u666f\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0a\u660e\u663e\u504f\u79bb\u771f\u5b9e\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\u51fa\u6765\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u76f8\u90bb\u5e27\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u80fd\u627e\u5230\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c6\u9891\u662f\u4eba\u5de5\u751f\u6210\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models\uff08VFM\uff09\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e0d\u8bba\u662f\u5b8f\u89c2\u573a\u666f\u8fd8\u662f\u7ec6\u5fae\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u4f2a\u9020\u75d5\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u51fa\u5373\u4f7f\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5951\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4f2a\u9020\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u4f2a\u9020\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u5a92\u4f53\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) mitigate these challenges by projecting the residual connection space onto a Birkhoff polytope, however, it faces two issues: 1) its iterative Sinkhorn-Knopp (SK) algorithm does not always yield exact doubly stochastic residual matrices; 2) mHC incurs a prohibitive $\\mathcal{O}(n^3C)$ parameter complexity with $n$ as the width of the residual stream and $C$ as the feature dimension. The recently proposed mHC-lite reparametrizes the residual matrix via the Birkhoff-von-Neumann theorem to guarantee double stochasticity, but also faces a factorial explosion in its parameter complexity, $\\mathcal{O} \\left( nC \\cdot n! \\right)$. To address both challenges, we propose \\textbf{KromHC}, which uses the \\underline{Kro}necker products of smaller doubly stochastic matrices to parametrize the residual matrix in \\underline{mHC}. By enforcing manifold constraints across the factor residual matrices along each mode of the tensorized residual stream, KromHC guarantees exact double stochasticity of the residual matrices while reducing parameter complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2C)$. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that KromHC matches or even outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) mHC variants, while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters.

However, large models demand substantial GPU memory and exhibit high inference latency, while conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggles to bridge the capability gaps of small models. To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a \"perception-reasoning-planning\" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines.

However, their reliability for quantitative 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding scenes remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a fundamental failure mode of implicit density fields under heavy occlusion, which we term Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD). We show that transmittance-based volumetric optimization satisfies photometric supervision by reconstructing hollow or fragmented structures rather than solid interiors, leading to systematic instance undercounting. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing occlusion, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs saturate at approximately 89% instance recovery in dense scenes, despite improved surface coherence and mask quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster), initialized from SfM feature geometry. By projecting 2D instance masks onto an explicit voxel grid and enforcing geometric separation via recursive splitting, our approach preserves physical solidity and achieves a 95.8% recovery rate in dense clusters. A sensitivity analysis using degraded segmentation masks further shows that explicit SfM-based geometry is substantially more robust to supervision failure, recovering 43% more instances than implicit baselines. These results demonstrate that explicit geometric priors are a prerequisite for reliable quantitative analysis in highly self-occluding 3D scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86NeRF\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u81ea\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u4f53\u7d20\u77e2\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6062\u590d\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "NeRFs\u5728\u81ea\u906e\u6321\u5bc6\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf3D\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u906e\u6321\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u76d1\u7763NeRF\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6062\u590d\u7387\u9971\u548c\u572889%\u5de6\u53f3\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eSfM\u7279\u5f81\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u4f53\u7d20\u77e2\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c062D\u5b9e\u4f8b\u63a9\u7801\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u4f53\u7d20\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u88c2\u786e\u4fdd\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8695.8%\u7684\u6062\u590d\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9000\u5316\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u65f6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSfM\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u9690\u5f0f\u7684\u6062\u590d\u4e8643%\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u906e\u63213D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u81ea\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf3D\u5206\u6790\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that transforms unimodal datasets into multimodal ones using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate synthetic image captions for fine-tuning models with a multimodal objective. Our method employs carefully designed prompts incorporating class labels and domain context to produce high-quality captions tailored for classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss function that explicitly encourages clustering of same-class representations during fine-tuning, along with a new inference technique that leverages class-averaged text embeddings from multiple synthetic captions per image.

ILRR guides generation by dynamically aligning the internal activations of the generated sequence with those of a given reference throughout the denoising process. This approach captures and transfers high-level semantic properties, with a tunable steering scale enabling flexible control over attributes such as sentiment. We further introduce Spatially Modulated Steering, an extension that enables steering long texts using shorter references by regulating guidance intensity across the sequence. Empirically, we demonstrate that ILRR achieves effective attribute steering on LLaDA and MDLM architectures with a minor computational overhead, requiring only one additional parallel forward pass per denoising step.

Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies. Subsequently, it models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path (e.g., conjunction, disjunction). This process generates an explainable causal mediator that approximates an ideal state isolated from confounding effects. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, offering multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCNRE\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u795e\u7ecf-\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u795e\u7ecf-\u7b26\u53f7\u6846\u67b6\uff0cCNRE\u80fd\u591f\u6a21\u62df\u7528\u6237\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u884c\u4e3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u5185\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u53d7\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u89c6\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e00\u822c\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf-\u7b26\u53f7\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "CNRE\u6a21\u578b\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u504f\u597d\u4f20\u64ad\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u884c\u4e3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u94fe\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u89c4\u5219\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u795e\u7ecf-\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff08\u5982\u5408\u53d6\u3001\u6790\u53d6\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u53d7\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCNRE\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u7ed3\u679c\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "CNRE\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing methods either compress visual embeddings or apply sparse attention on a single GPU, yielding limited acceleration or degraded performance and restricting LMMs from handling longer, more complex videos. To overcome these issues, we propose Spava, a sequence-parallel framework with optimized attention that accelerates long-video inference across multiple GPUs. By distributing approximate attention, Spava reduces computation and increases parallelism, enabling efficient processing of more visual embeddings without compression and thereby improving task performance. System-level optimizations, such as load balancing and fused forward passes, further unleash the potential of Spava, delivering speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, without notable performance loss.

The standard approach involves training a general-purpose tokenizer that uniformly processes all textual data during both training and inference. However, the use of a generic set of tokens can incur inefficiencies when applying the model to specific domains or languages. To address this limitation, we propose a post-training adaptation strategy that selectively replaces low-utility tokens with more relevant ones based on their frequency in an adaptation corpus. Our algorithm identifies the token inventory that most effectively encodes the adaptation corpus for a given target vocabulary size. Extensive experiments on generation and classification tasks across multiple languages demonstrate that our adapted tokenizers compress test corpora more effectively than baselines using the same vocabulary size. This method serves as a lightweight adaptation mechanism, akin to a vocabulary fine-tuning process, enabling optimized tokenization for specific domains or tasks.

Accepted by ICASSP 2026", "summary": "Metric learning is central to retrieval, yet its effects on embedding geometry and optimization dynamics are not well understood. We introduce a diagnostic framework, VARIANCE (intra-/inter-class variance) and GREEDINESS (active ratio and gradient norms), to compare seven representative losses, i.e., Contrastive, Triplet, N-pair, InfoNCE, ArcFace, SCL, and CCL, across five image-retrieval datasets. Our analysis reveals that Triplet and SCL preserve higher within-class variance and clearer inter-class margins, leading to stronger top-1 retrieval in fine-grained settings. In contrast, Contrastive and InfoNCE compact embeddings are achieved quickly through many small updates, accelerating convergence but potentially oversimplifying class structures. N-pair achieves a large mean separation but with uneven spacing.

Our analysis reveals two distinct dynamical regimes: short-time power-law scaling, which differentiates creative literature from technical texts, and a long-time crossover to a stability-limited noise floor. We find that while large language models successfully mimic the local scaling statistics of human text, they exhibit a systematic reduction in their stability horizon.

To address these challenges, we propose EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate interpretation of long-horizon structured EHR data. EHR-RAG introduces three components tailored to longitudinal clinical prediction tasks: Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries in order to expand broad evidence coverage, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieves and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence. Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%.

The prohibitive cost of frame-level annotation makes weakly supervised methods a practical necessity, which rely only on video-level labels. To this end, we propose Reconstruction-based Temporal Deepfake Localization (RT-DeepLoc), a weakly supervised temporal forgery localization framework that identifies forgeries via reconstruction errors. Our framework uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained exclusively on authentic data to learn its intrinsic spatiotemporal patterns; this allows the model to produce significant reconstruction discrepancies for forged segments, effectively providing the missing fine-grained cues for localization.

Nevertheless, their deployment in Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS) scenarios encounters two major obstacles: (i) real-world FSRS data, collected from heterogeneous acquisition devices, are highly noisy and lack auditable, closed-loop data curation, which impedes the construction of high-quality, controllable, and reproducible training corpora; and (ii) existing evaluation protocols do not offer a unified, fine-grained and standardized benchmark spanning single-image, multi-image, and video inputs, making it challenging to objectively gauge model robustness. To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures. Notably, it surpasses the substantially larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7, and exceeds the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, demonstrating significantly improved parameter efficiency.

To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{Recycling Search Experience (RSE)}, a self-guided, training-free strategy that turns test-time search from a series of isolated trials into a cumulative process. By actively distilling raw trajectories into a shared experience bank, RSE enables positive recycling of intermediate conclusions to shortcut redundant derivations and negative recycling of failure patterns to prune encountered dead ends. Theoretically, we provide an analysis that formalizes the efficiency gains of RSE, validating its advantage over independent sampling in solving complex reasoning tasks.

The ability to generate crash-like imagery challenges the boundary between authentic and synthetic data, introducing new risks of misuse in fraud or claim manipulation. To address these issues, we propose HERS (Hidden-Pattern Expert Learning for Risk-Specific Damage Adaptation), a framework designed to improve fidelity, controllability, and domain alignment of diffusion-generated damage images. HERS fine-tunes a base diffusion model via domain-specific expert adaptation without requiring manual annotation. Using self-supervised image-text pairs automatically generated by a large language model and T2I pipeline, HERS models each damage category, such as dents, scratches, broken lights, or cracked paint, as a separate expert. These experts are later integrated into a unified multi-damage model that balances specialization with generalization.

Recent latent reasoning approaches attempt to optimize efficiency by performing reasoning within continuous hidden states.

In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks reveal a distinct trade-off: while PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines, it demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity.

Prior works have identified individual patterns such as retrieval heads, sink heads, and diagonal traces, yet these observations remain fragmented and lack a unifying explanation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Temporal Attention Pattern Predictability Analysis (TAPPA), a unifying framework that explains diverse attention patterns by analyzing their underlying mathematical formulations} from a temporally continuous perspective. TAPPA both deepens the understanding of attention behavior and guides inference acceleration approaches. Specifically, TAPPA characterizes attention patterns as predictable patterns with clear regularities and unpredictable patterns that appear effectively random. Our analysis further reveals that this distinction can be explained by the degree of query self-similarity along the temporal dimension. Focusing on the predictable patterns, we further provide a detailed mathematical analysis of three representative cases through the joint effect of queries, keys, and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We validate TAPPA by applying its insights to KV cache compression and LLM pruning tasks.

However, eliciting long CoT typically requires large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) training, while often leading to overthinking with redundant intermediate steps. To improve learning and reasoning efficiency, while preserving or even enhancing performance, we propose TACLer, a model-tailored curriculum reinforcement learning framework that gradually increases the complexity of the data based on the model's proficiency in multi-stage RL training. TACLer features two core components: (i) tailored curriculum learning that determines what knowledge the model lacks and needs to learn in progressive stages; (ii) a hybrid Thinking/NoThinking reasoning paradigm that balances accuracy and efficiency by enabling or disabling the Thinking mode. Our experiments show that TACLer yields a twofold advantage in learning and reasoning: (i) it reduces computational cost, cutting training compute by over 50% compared to long thinking models and reducing inference token usage by over 42% relative to the base model; and (ii) it improves accuracy by over 9% on the base model, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art Nothinking and Thinking baselines across four math datasets with complex problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "TACLer \u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u957f\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u62e5\u6709\u6216\u589e\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 TACLer \u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "TACLer \u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ca\u5176\u6e10\u8fdb\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u601d\u7ef4/\u975e\u601d\u8003\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u542f\u7528\u6216\u7981\u6b62\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTACLer \u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4e24\u500d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff1a\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u5b83\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u957f\u601d\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7 50%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u76f8\u5bf9\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7 42%\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b 9% \u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8fc7\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u975e\u601d\u8003\u548c\u601d\u8003\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "TACLer \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing methods are often constrained by coarse-grained control mechanisms or fixed mapping schedules, yielding suboptimal adaptation. To address this, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Bridge Model (UDBM), which innovatively reformulates AiOIR as a stochastic transport problem steered by pixel-wise uncertainty. By introducing a relaxed diffusion bridge formulation which replaces the strict terminal constraint with a relaxed constraint, we model the uncertainty of degradations while theoretically resolving the drift singularity inherent in standard diffusion bridges. Furthermore, we devise a dual modulation strategy: the noise schedule aligns diverse degradations into a shared high-entropy latent space, while the path schedule adaptively regulates the transport trajectory motivated by the viscous dynamics of entropy regularization. By effectively rectifying the transport geometry and dynamics, UDBM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse restoration tasks within a single inference step.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Bridge Model (UDBM)\uff0c\u521b\u65b0\u5730\u5c06All-in-One\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d(AiOIR)\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u7531\u50cf\u7d20\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u677e\u5f1b\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6865\u6881\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u5404\u79cd\u9000\u5316\u7edf\u4e00\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u71b5\u7684\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u9000\u5316\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UDBM\u3002", "method": "UDBM\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u653e\u677e\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6865\u6881\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u968f\u673a\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u89e3\u51b3AiOIR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8def\u5f84\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u8ba1\u5212\u5171\u540c\u8c03\u8282\u8fd0\u8f93\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ad8\u71b5\u7684\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6865\u6881\u4e2d\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u5947\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "UDBM\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "UDBM\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u56fe\u5f62\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches relying on manual sampling or expensive commercial systems fail to address accessibility challenges in resource-constrained environments. This paper presents HydroSense, an innovative Internet of Things framework that integrates six critical water quality parameters including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), estimated nitrogen, and water level into a unified monitoring system. HydroSense employs a novel dual-microcontroller architecture, utilizing Arduino Uno for precision analog measurements with five-point calibration algorithms and ESP32 for wireless connectivity, edge processing, and cloud integration. The system implements advanced signal processing techniques including median filtering for TDS measurement, temperature compensation algorithms, and robust error handling. Experimental validation over 90 days demonstrates exceptional performance metrics: pH accuracy of plus or minus 0.08 units across the 0 to 14 range, DO measurement stability within plus or minus 0.2 mg/L, TDS accuracy of plus or minus 1.9 percent across 0 to 1000 ppm, and 99.8 percent cloud data transmission reliability.

We study an alternative setting where the model is initially exposed to abstract structured data, as a means to ease the subsequent acquisition of rich semantic knowledge, much like humans learn simple logic and mathematics before higher reasoning. We specifically focus on procedural data, generated by formal languages and other simple algorithms, as such abstract data.\n  We first diagnose the algorithmic skills that different forms of procedural data can improve, often significantly. For example, on context recall (Needle-in-a-haystack), the accuracy jumps from 10 to 98% when pretraining on Dyck sequences (balanced brackets). Second, we study how these gains are reflected in pretraining larger models (up to 1.3B). We find that front-loading as little as 0.1% procedural data significantly outperforms standard pretraining on natural language, code, and informal mathematics (C4, CodeParrot, and DeepMind-Math datasets). Notably, this procedural pretraining enables the models to reach the same loss value with only 55, 67, 86% of the original data. Third, we explore the mechanisms behind and find that procedural pretraining instils non-trivial structure in both attention and MLP layers. The former is particularly important for structured domains (e.g. code), and the latter for language. Finally, we lay a path for combining multiple forms of procedural data. Our results show that procedural pretraining is a simple, lightweight means to improving performance and accelerating language model pretraining, ultimately suggesting the promise of disentangling knowledge acquisition from reasoning in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u672c\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u5176\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5148\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u540e\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u591f\u6539\u5584\u54ea\u4e9b\u7b97\u6cd5\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6700\u5927\u81f31.3B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5c42\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u75280.1%\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u6570\u5b66\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u635f\u5931\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u52a0\u5feb\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u6697\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u79bb\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To address these gaps, we propose WMVLM, the first unified and interpretable evaluation framework for diffusion model image watermarking via vision-language models (VLMs). We redefine quality and security metrics for each watermark type: residual watermarks are evaluated by artifact strength and erasure resistance, while semantic watermarks are assessed through latent distribution shifts.

Existing retrieval augmentation methods often rely on isolated text chunks or concepts, but overlook deeper semantic connections between papers. This impairs the LLM's comprehension of scientific literature, hindering the comprehensiveness and specificity of its responses. To address this, we propose Central Entity-Guided Graph Optimization for Community Detection (CE-GOCD), a method that augments LLMs' scientific question answering by explicitly modeling and leveraging semantic substructures within academic knowledge graphs. Our approach operates by: (1) leveraging paper titles as central entities for targeted subgraph retrieval, (2) enhancing implicit semantic discovery via subgraph pruning and completion, and (3) applying community detection to distill coherent paper groups with shared themes. We evaluated the proposed method on three NLP literature-based question-answering datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority over other retrieval-augmented baseline approaches, confirming the effectiveness of our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cCE-GOCD\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6027\u548c\u5177\u4f53\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7247\u6bb5\u6216\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e4b\u95f4\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "CE-GOCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6587\u7ae0\u6807\u9898\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5b9e\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u9690\u5f0f\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u56fe\u4fee\u526a\u548c\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u793e\u533a\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee5\u63d0\u70bc\u5177\u6709\u5171\u540c\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u7ec4\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6587\u732e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u56de\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff0cCE-GOCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u56de\u7b54\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Recent studies have thus pursued making System 2 models more efficient. However, these approaches focused on output control, limiting what models produce. We argue that this paradigm is misaligned: output length is merely a symptom of the model's cognitive configuration, not the root cause. In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \\textit{how models think} rather than \\textit{what they produce}. To realize this, we leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training. Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \\textbf{DAMI} (\\textbf{D}yn\\textbf{A}mic \\textbf{M}odel \\textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $\u03bb(q)$ to configure cognitive depth. For training-based estimation, we develop a preference learning method encoding accuracy and efficiency criteria. For zero-shot deployment, we introduce a confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy.

However, current systems often reduce diagnosis to directly output conclusions without verifiable evidence-linked reasoning, which severely limits clinical trust and hinders expert error rectification. To address these barriers, we construct PathReasoner, the first large-scale dataset of whole-slide image (WSI) reasoning. Unlike previous work reliant on unverified distillation, we develop a rigorous knowledge-guided generation pipeline. By leveraging medical knowledge graphs, we explicitly align structured pathological findings and clinical reasoning with diagnoses, generating over 20K high-quality instructional samples. Based on the database, we propose PathReasoner-R1, which synergizes trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning to instill structured chain-of-thought capabilities. To ensure medical rigor, we engineer a knowledge-aware multi-granular reward function incorporating an Entity Reward mechanism strictly aligned with knowledge graphs. This effectively guides the model to optimize for logical consistency rather than mere outcome matching, thereby enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathReasoner-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PathReasoner and public benchmarks across various image scales, equipping pathology models with transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities.

Existing internal self-contrastive decoding methods, such as Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), focus on discrepancies across different layers, which are notably unstable on small-scale models. In this work, based on the observation that LLMs exhibit local preferences, we propose a novel contrastive guidance strategy along the temporal dimension, namely Temporal Guidance (TeGu). Our method ingeniously leverages Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) to construct weaker amateur predictions for model self-contrast. To standardize the implementation of this mechanism, we further introduce a lightweight Conditional MTP Projector (cMTPP), which avoids maintaining multiple independent networks as required by other MTP modules.

Yet many large language models do the opposite: they interpret negated instructions as affirmations. We audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios and found that open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation -- a 317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones. These patterns hold under deterministic decoding, ruling out sampling noise. We present case studies showing how these failures play out in practice, propose the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric, and outline a tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds.

While this literature shows that there is an area where model representations are similar, we study here how vision models might get to those representations--in particular, do they also converge to the same intermediate steps and operations? We therefore study the processes that lead to convergent representations in different models. First, we quantify distance between different model representations at different stages. We follow the evolution of distances between models throughout processing, identifying the processing steps which are most different between models. We find that while layers at similar positions in different models have the most similar representations, strong differences remain. Classifier models, unlike the others, will discard information about low-level image statistics in their final layers. CNN- and transformer-based models also behave differently, with transformer models applying smoother changes to representations from one layer to the next. These distinctions clarify the level and nature of convergence between model representations, and enables a more qualitative account of the underlying processes in image models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8868\u793a\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u4f3c\u5c42\u7684\u8868\u793a\u8f83\u4e3a\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u5dee\u5f02\u4f9d\u7136\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u4f1a\u4e22\u5f03\u4f4e\u7ea7\u56fe\u50cf\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u6536\u655b\u5230\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u201c\u666e\u904d\u201d\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6216\u6a21\u6001\u5982\u4f55\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u4e86\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u8fbe\u5230\u8fd9\u4e9b\u901a\u7528\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u4e2a\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8ddd\u79bb\u968f\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u6700\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u4f3c\u5c42\u7684\u8868\u793a\u8f83\u4e3a\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u5dee\u5f02\u4f9d\u7136\u663e\u8457\u3002\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u4f1a\u4e22\u5f03\u4f4e\u7ea7\u56fe\u50cf\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff1bCNN-\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f8\u90bb\u5c42\u95f4\u7684\u8868\u793a\u53d8\u5316\u66f4\u4e3a\u5e73\u6ed1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u5c42\u53ef\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u5e95\u5c42\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u4e2d\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6f84\u6e05\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8868\u793a\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u6027\u8d28\u3002"}}

In this work, we uncover a striking \"Paradox of Robustness\": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be \"brittle\" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably \"stable\" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts.

In recent ImageNet-scale AE studies, we observe a systematic bias toward generative metrics in handling this trade-off: reconstruction metrics are increasingly under-reported, and ablation-based AE selection often favors the best-gFID configuration even when reconstruction fidelity degrades. We theoretically analyze why this gFID-dominant preference can appear unproblematic for ImageNet generation, yet becomes risky when scaling to controllable diffusion: AEs can induce condition drift, which limits achievable condition alignment. Meanwhile, we find that reconstruction fidelity, especially instance-level measures, better indicates controllability. We empirically validate the impact of tilted autoencoder evaluation on controllability by studying several recent ImageNet AEs. Using a multi-dimensional condition-drift evaluation protocol reflecting controllable generation tasks, we find that gFID is only weakly predictive of condition preservation, whereas reconstruction-oriented metrics are substantially more aligned. ControlNet experiments further confirm that controllability tracks condition preservation rather than gFID. Overall, our results expose a gap between ImageNet-centric AE evaluation and the requirements of scalable controllable diffusion, offering practical guidance for more reliable benchmarking and model selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21ImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08AE\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6307\u6807\u8fc7\u5ea6\u504f\u91cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002AE\u4f18\u5316\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u53cb\u597d\u4f46\u635f\u91cd\u5efa\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6307\u6807\u6bd4\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u8ddd\u79bb\uff08gFID\uff09\u66f4\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30AE\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u91cd\u5efa\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u7ea0\u6b63\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53cb\u597d\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728ImageNet\u7b49\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0AE\u4e2d\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u504f\u79fb\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u504f\u79fb\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5bf9\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u901a\u8fc7ControlNet\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u8ddd\u79bb\uff08gFID\uff09\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u4fdd\u7559\u65b9\u9762\u53ea\u5177\u6709\u5f31\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u4fdd\u7559\u66f4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0cAE\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u52a0\u6ce8\u91cd\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u66f4\u5c11\u4f9d\u8d56\u751f\u6210\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u63a7\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u3002"}}

Owing to the vast spatial scale and high semantic ambiguity of remote sensing scenes, these descriptions often rely heavily on positional cues, posing unique challenges for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in spatial reasoning. To leverage this unique feature, we propose a reasoning-guided, position-aware post-training framework, dubbed \\textbf{RSGround-R1}, to progressively enhance spatial understanding. Specifically, we first introduce Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) using synthetically generated RSVG reasoning data to establish explicit position awareness.

We introduce Zonkey, a hierarchical diffusion model that addresses these limitations through a fully trainable pipeline from raw characters to document-level representations. At its core is a differentiable tokenizer (Segment Splitter) that learns probabilistic beginning-of-sequence (BOS) decisions, enabling adaptive splits that emerge as linguistically meaningful (e.g., word boundaries at spaces, sentence starts at periods) without explicit supervision. This differentiability is enabled by our novel Probabilistic Attention mechanism, which incorporates position-specific existence probabilities to simulate soft masking over theoretically infinite sequences while preserving gradients. Sequences decay probabilistically rather than relying on end-of-sequence tokens, supporting variable-length outputs. Hierarchical levels compress sequences into higher abstractions (e.g., character n-grams to word-like vectors, then sentence-like), with reconstruction via our Denoising Diffusion Mixed Model (DDMM) for stable and efficient denoising in latent space. A Stitcher ensures overlap invariance across segments. Trained end-to-end on Wikipedia, Zonkey generates coherent, variable-length text from noise, demonstrating emergent hierarchies and promising qualitative alignment to data distributions compared to entropy-based learnable tokenizers. Our approach advances toward fully gradient-based LLMs, with potential for better domain adaptation and scalable generation.

However, existing OCR methods primarily focus on recognizing text elements from images or scanned documents (\\textbf{Text-centric OCR}), neglecting the identification of visual elements from visually information-dense image sources (\\textbf{Vision-centric OCR}), such as charts, web pages and science plots. In reality, these visually information-dense images are widespread on the internet and have significant real-world application value, such as data visualization and web page analysis. In this technical report, we propose \\textbf{OCRVerse}, the first holistic OCR method in end-to-end manner that enables unified text-centric OCR and vision-centric OCR. To this end, we constructe comprehensive data engineering to cover a wide range of text-centric documents, such as newspapers, magazines and books, as well as vision-centric rendered composites, including charts, web pages and scientific plots. Moreover, we propose a two-stage SFT-RL multi-domain training method for OCRVerse. SFT directly mixes cross-domain data to train and establish initial domain knowledge, while RL focuses on designing personalized reward strategies for the characteristics of each domain. Specifically, since different domains require various output formats and expected outputs, we provide sufficient flexibility in the RL stage to customize flexible reward signals for each domain, thereby improving cross-domain fusion and avoiding data conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of OCRVerse, achieving competitive results across text-centric and vision-centric data types, even comparable to large-scale open-source and closed-source models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u62a5\u544a\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aOCRVerse\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21OCR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5SFT-RL\u591a\u9886\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684OCR\u6280\u672f\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u626b\u63cf\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4ece\u56fe\u8868\u3001\u7f51\u9875\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u96c6\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u4e0a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5982\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u7f51\u9875\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684OCR\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5927\u91cf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "OCRVerse\u91c7\u7528\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684OCR\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u7a0b\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5SFT-RL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cSFT\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u7acb\u8de8\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u800cRL\u5219\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOCRVerse\u5728\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u6280\u672f\u62a5\u544a\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86OCR\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u5bc6\u96c6\u56fe\u50cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Despite clustering topic models' apparent success, we identify a number of issues in Top2Vec and BERTopic, which remain largely unsolved. Firstly, these approaches are unreliable at discovering natural clusters in corpora, due to extreme sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, the default values of which result in suboptimal behaviour. Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus. This results in, on the one hand, less coherent topics due to the presence of stop words and junk words, and lack of variety and trust on the other. In this paper, I introduce a new approach, \\textbf{Topeax}, which discovers the number of clusters from peaks in density estimates, and combines lexical and semantic indices of term importance to gain high-quality topic keywords. Topeax is demonstrated to be better at both cluster recovery and cluster description than Top2Vec and BERTopic, while also exhibiting less erratic behaviour in response to changing sample size and hyperparameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "Topeax\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6587\u672c\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5cf0\u503c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u786e\u5b9a\u805a\u7c7b\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u672f\u8bed\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6807\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u5173\u952e\u5b57\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u96c6\u7fa4\u6062\u590d\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eTop2Vec\u548cBERTopic\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684Top2Vec\u548cBERTopic\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u7c07\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u672f\u8bed\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "Topeax\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u7c07\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6307\u6807\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3b\u9898\u5173\u952e\u5b57\u3002", "result": "Topeax\u5728\u96c6\u7fa4\u6062\u590d\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684Top2Vec\u548cBERTopic\u3002", "conclusion": "Topeax\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

While recent deep learning approaches for depression detection have shown promise, most rely on limited feature types, overlook explicit cross-modal interactions, and employ simple concatenation or static weighting for fusion. To overcome these limitations, we propose CAF-Mamba, a novel Mamba-based cross-modal adaptive attention fusion framework. CAF-Mamba not only captures cross-modal interactions explicitly and implicitly, but also dynamically adjusts modality contributions through a modality-wise attention mechanism, enabling more effective multimodal fusion.

However, the opacity of how these components interact creates challenges for deployment in high-stakes domains. We present RAG-E, an end-to-end explainability framework that quantifies retriever-generator alignment through mathematically grounded attribution methods. Our approach adapts Integrated Gradients for retriever analysis, introduces PMCSHAP, a Monte Carlo-stabilized Shapley Value approximation, for generator attribution, and introduces the Weighted Attribution-Relevance Gap (WARG) metric to measure how well a generator's document usage aligns with a retriever's ranking. Empirical analysis on TREC CAsT and FoodSafeSum reveals critical misalignments: for 47.4% to 66.7% of queries, generators ignore the retriever's top-ranked documents, while 48.1% to 65.9% rely on documents ranked as less relevant.

Most existing TTRL methods rely on majority voting (MV) over rollouts to produce deterministic rewards, implicitly assuming that the majority rollout provides a reliable learning signal. We show that this assumption is fragile: MV reduces the rollout distribution into a single outcome, discarding information about non-majority but correct actions candidates, and yields systematically biased reward estimates. To address this, we propose Distribution-AwareReward Estimation (DARE), which shifts reward estimation from a single majority outcome to the full empirical rollout distribution. DARE further augments this distribution-based reward with an exploration bonus and a distribution pruning mechanism for non-majority rollout exploration and reward denoise, yielding a more informative and robust reward estimation.

This need is especially acute for geospatial planning problems, such as those found in planning for large-scale military operations, which demand fast and accurate reasoning over maps, orders, intelligence reports, and other distributed data. To address this gap, we present MilSCORE (Military Scenario Contextual Reasoning), to our knowledge the first scenario-level dataset of expert-authored, multi-hop questions grounded in a complex, simulated military planning scenario used for training. MilSCORE is designed to evaluate high-stakes decision-making and planning, probing LLMs' ability to combine tactical and spatial reasoning across multiple sources and to reason over long-horizon, geospatially rich context.

This research advances the literature in three significant directions. First, while previous work demonstrated the technical feasibility of steering emotional tone using automated classifiers, this paper presents the first human evaluation of activation steering concerning the emotional tone of LLM outputs, collecting over 7,000 crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants via Prolific ($n=190$). These ratings assess both perceived emotional intensity and overall text quality. Second, we find strong alignment between human and model-based quality ratings (mean $r=0.776$, range $0.157$--$0.985$), indicating automatic scoring can proxy perceived quality. Moderate steering strengths ($\u03bb\\approx 0.15$) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility, with the strongest effects for disgust ($\u03b7_p^2 = 0.616$) and fear ($\u03b7_p^2 = 0.540$), and minimal effects for surprise ($\u03b7_p^2 = 0.042$). Finally, upgrading from Alpaca to LlaMA-3 yielded more consistent steering with significant effects across emotions and strengths (all $p < 0.001$). Inter-rater reliability was high (ICC $= 0.71$--$0.87$), underscoring the robustness of the findings.

Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) suboptimal motion injection strategies that lead to a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, manifesting as a \"see-saw\", and (2) an over-reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons), which inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary, non-humanoid characters. To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem. Our approach follows a two-stage paradigm. First, we bridge the input modality gap by fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space, enabling the model to jointly reason about spatial identity and temporal dynamics by leveraging the generative prior of foundational models. Second, we introduce a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline that curates pseudo cross-identity training pairs, facilitating a seamless transition from pose-dependent control to direct, end-to-end RGB-driven animation. This strategy significantly enhances generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we further introduce AW Bench, a versatile benchmark encompassing a wide spectrum of characters types and motion scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamActor-M2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization.

Yet, their ability to produce highly human-like text raises serious concerns about misinformation and academic integrity, making it an urgent need for reliable algorithms to detect LLM-generated content. In this paper, we start by presenting a geometric approach to demystify rewrite-based detection algorithms, revealing their underlying rationale and demonstrating their generalization ability. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between the original and rewritten text. Theoretically, we demonstrate that employing an adaptively learned distance function is more effective for detection than using a fixed distance. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments with over 100 settings, and find that our approach demonstrates superior performance over baseline algorithms in the majority of scenarios. In particular, it achieves relative improvements from 57.8\\% to 80.6\\% over the strongest baseline across different target LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, and Gemini).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u6790\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5199\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u91cd\u5199\u6587\u672c\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6570\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u5584\u4ece57.8%\u523080.6%\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5982GPT\u3001Claude\u548cGemini\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u8bda\u4fe1\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d8\u5f97\u8feb\u5207\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u5148\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u6790\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5199\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u91cd\u5199\u6587\u672c\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u51fd\u6570\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u8ddd\u79bb\u51fd\u6570\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u5728\u8d85\u8fc7100\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\u4ece57.8%\u523080.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5199\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u4fe1\u606f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u6311\u6218\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

While widely adopted, these metrics reduce performance to a single scalar, failing to capture how ranking consistency varies across the local quality spectrum. For example, two IQA models may achieve identical SRCC values, yet one ranks high-quality images (related to high Mean Opinion Score, MOS) more reliably, while the other better discriminates image pairs with small quality/MOS differences (related to $|\u0394$MOS$|$). Such complementary behaviors are invisible under global metrics. Moreover, SRCC and PLCC are sensitive to test-sample quality distributions, yielding unstable comparisons across test sets. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Granularity-Modulated Correlation (GMC)}, which provides a structured, fine-grained analysis of IQA performance. GMC includes: (1) a \\textbf{Granularity Modulator} that applies Gaussian-weighted correlations conditioned on absolute MOS values and pairwise MOS differences ($|\u0394$MOS$|$) to examine local performance variations, and (2) a \\textbf{Distribution Regulator} that regularizes correlations to mitigate biases from non-uniform quality distributions. The resulting \\textbf{correlation surface} maps correlation values as a joint function of MOS and $|\u0394$MOS$|$, providing a 3D representation of IQA performance. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that GMC reveals performance characteristics invisible to scalar metrics, offering a more informative and reliable paradigm for analyzing, comparing, and deploying IQA models.

By integrating dynamic budget training, SONIC allows flexible adaptation to varying memory constraints without retraining.

Explicit topological maps have proven to be a vital solution for providing robust spatial memory in such tasks. However, existing topological planning methods suffer from a \"Granularity Rigidity\" problem. Specifically, these methods typically rely on fixed geometric thresholds to sample nodes, which fails to adapt to varying environmental complexities. This rigidity leads to a critical mismatch: the model tends to over-sample in simple areas, causing computational redundancy, while under-sampling in high-uncertainty regions, increasing collision risks and compromising precision. To address this, we propose DGNav, a framework for Dynamic Topological Navigation, introducing a context-aware mechanism to modulate map density and connectivity on-the-fly. Our approach comprises two core innovations: (1) A Scene-Aware Adaptive Strategy that dynamically modulates graph construction thresholds based on the dispersion of predicted waypoints, enabling \"densification on demand\" in challenging environments; (2) A Dynamic Graph Transformer that reconstructs graph connectivity by fusing visual, linguistic, and geometric cues into dynamic edge weights, enabling the agent to filter out topological noise and enhancing instruction adherence. Extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate DGNav exhibits superior navigation performance and strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that our framework achieves an optimal trade-off between navigation efficiency and safe exploration.

However, modeling long, domain-specific clinical text remains challenging due to limited labeled data, severe class imbalance, and the high computational cost of adapting large pretrained language models.\n  This study presents a GPT-based architecture for clinical text classification that adapts a pretrained decoder-only Transformer using a selective fine-tuning strategy. Rather than updating all model parameters, the majority of the GPT-2 backbone is frozen, and training is restricted to the final Transformer block, the final layer normalization, and a lightweight classification head. This approach substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving the representational capacity required to model complex clinical language.\n  The proposed method is evaluated on radiology reports from the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset using uncertainty-aware CheXpert-style labels derived directly from report text. Experiments cover multiple problem formulations, including multi-label classification of radiographic findings, binary per-label classification under different uncertainty assumptions, and aggregate disease outcome prediction. Across varying dataset sizes, the model exhibits stable convergence behavior and strong classification performance, particularly in settings dominated by non-mention and negated findings.\n  Overall, the results indicate that selective fine-tuning of pretrained generative language models provides an efficient and effective pathway for clinical text classification, enabling scalable adaptation to real-world EHR data while significantly reducing computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGPT\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5668Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u5f3a\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHRs\uff09\u4e2d\u4e34\u5e8a\u53d9\u4e8b\u6587\u672c\u7684\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u957f\u4e14\u4e13\u4e1a\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u90e8\u5206GPT-2\u4e3b\u5e72\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u7684Transformer\u5757\u3001\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u5c42\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5934\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bed\u8a00\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728MIMIC-IV-Note\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4ee5\u53ca\u603b\u4f53\u75be\u75c5\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u8ff0\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645EHR\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Across diverse benchmarks and an open-ended use case, ARGORA achieves competitive accuracy and demonstrates corrective behavior: when experts initially disagree, the framework resolves disputes toward correct answers more often than it introduces new errors, while providing causal diagnostics of decisive arguments.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARGORA \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u56fe\u6765\u7ec4\u7ec7\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u79fb\u9664\u4e2a\u522b\u8bba\u636e\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bc6\u522b\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4fee\u6539\u4e0b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8fd8\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ea0\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f53\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u5224\u65ad\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4f46\u7b80\u5355\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f7f\u5f97\u96be\u4ee5\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6700\u7ec8\u51b3\u7b56\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u8bba\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51faARGORA\u4ee5\u6e05\u6670\u5c55\u793a\u652f\u6301\u6216\u53cd\u9a73\u7684\u8bba\u636e\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5206\u6790\u5355\u4e2a\u8bba\u636e\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "ARGORA \u6784\u5efa\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u56fe\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5904\u7406\u3002\u5b83\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206\uff1a(1) \u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u5448\u73b0\u652f\u6301\u6216\u53cd\u9a73\u7684\u8bba\u636e\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b(2) \u4f7f\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u79fb\u9664\u8bba\u636e\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u54ea\u4e9b\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u4fee\u6539\u4e0b\u6539\u53d8\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cARGORA \u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7ea0\u6b63\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u6700\u521d\u610f\u89c1\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u66f4\u591a\u5730\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u800c\u975e\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u8bba\u636e\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "ARGORA \u4e3a\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u52a0\u900f\u660e\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

We introduce On-policy Verbal Distillation (OVD), a memory-efficient framework that replaces token-level probability matching with trajectory matching using discrete verbal scores (0--9) from teacher models. OVD dramatically reduces memory consumption while enabling on-policy distillation from teacher models with verbal feedback, and avoids token-level alignment, allowing the student model to freely explore the output space. Extensive experiments on Web question answering and mathematical reasoning tasks show that OVD substantially outperforms existing methods, delivering up to +12.9% absolute improvement in average EM on Web Q&A tasks and a up to +25.7% gain on math benchmarks (when trained with only one random samples), while also exhibiting superior training efficiency.

However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Crucially, we uncover a \"less is more\" phenomenon via our difficulty-aware filtering strategy: a subset of just 7\\% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset. Notably, we reveal a synergistic effect where reasoning-oriented data composition simultaneously boosts general capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aMMFineReason\u7684\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1.8M\u6837\u672c\u548c5.1B\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6STEM\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u8c1c\u9898\u3001\u6e38\u620f\u548c\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u8868\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u90fd\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\u5efa\u7acb\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u96be\u6613\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u589e\u5f3a\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5f00\u6e90Vision Language Models\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728STEM\u56fe\u8868\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8c1c\u9898\u7b49\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u957f\u671f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u6ce8\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90fd\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "MMFineReason\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1. \u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\uff1b2. \u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7406\u7531\uff1b3. \u6839\u636e\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u6b64\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u53d6\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "MMFineReason \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b 1.8M \u6837\u672c\u548c 5.1B \u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u8986\u76d6 STEM \u95ee\u9898\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u8c1c\u9898\u3001\u6e38\u620f\u548c\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u8868\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03 Qwen3-VL-Instruct\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86 2B/4B/8B \u7248\u672c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u81ea\u89c4\u6a21\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684 SOTA \u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u8be54B\u7248\u672c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86 Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking\uff0c\u800c8B\u7248\u672c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e8630B\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u60ca\u4eba\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u96be\u6613\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ec5\u9009\u53d6 7% \uff08123K \u6837\u672c\uff09\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "MMFineReason \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u66f4\u5e7f\u8986\u76d6\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5176\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u89c4\u6a21\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u201c\u5c11\u5373\u662f\u591a\u201d\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u8fc7\u5f80\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u7684\u5171\u540c\u589e\u76ca\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents. By reframing diffusion as trajectory design in latent space, we offer a principled approach to consistent and structured generative modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u6587\u6863\u80cc\u666f\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u800c\u975e\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9e\u73b0\u524d\u666f\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u591a\u9875\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u53ca\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u907f\u514d\u524d\u666f\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u673a\u5236\u5373\u53ef\u4fdd\u6301\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u8bfb\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u8026\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u65b9\u5411\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u9875\u9762\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u9875\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5f0f\u98ce\u683c\u6307\u5b9a\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u4e3b\u5e72\u517c\u5bb9\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u524d\u666f\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u80cc\u666f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u9875\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u98ce\u683c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u524d\u666f\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u6269\u6563\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u6765\u751f\u6210\u80cc\u666f\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u907f\u514d\u524d\u666f\u533a\u57df\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u8de8\u9875\u9762\u7684\u6837\u5f0f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7f13\u5b58\u98ce\u683c\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\u9650\u5236\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u6837\u5f0f\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u524d\u666f\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u591a\u9875\u6587\u6863\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5f0f\u98ce\u683c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u591a\u9875\u6587\u6863\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u52a0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We present an evaluation-driven workflow - Define, Test, Diagnose, Fix - that turns these challenges into a repeatable engineering loop.\n  We introduce the Minimum Viable Evaluation Suite (MVES), a tiered set of recommended evaluation components for (i) general LLM applications, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and (iii) agentic tool-use workflows. We also synthesize common evaluation methods (automated checks, human rubrics, and LLM-as-judge) and discuss known judge failure modes.\n  In reproducible local experiments (Ollama; Llama 3 8B Instruct and Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct), we observe that a generic \"improved\" prompt template can trade off behaviors: on our small structured suites, extraction pass rate decreased from 100% to 90% and RAG compliance from 93.3% to 80% for Llama 3 when replacing task-specific prompts with generic rules, while instruction-following improved. These findings motivate evaluation-driven prompt iteration and careful claim calibration rather than universal prompt recipes.\n  All test suites, harnesses, and results are included for reproducibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5de5\u7a0b\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08MVES\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u8bc4\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5177\u6709\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u518d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u9a71\u52a8\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5957\u4ef6\uff08MVES\uff09\uff0c\u8fd8\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u5e38\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u67e5\u3001\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5224\u3001LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\uff09\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u4ee5\u53ca\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4e3b\u5224\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u7528\u7684\u201c\u6539\u8fdb\u201d\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u677f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6743\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u4ece100%\u964d\u81f390%\uff0cRAG\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u4ece93.3%\u964d\u81f380%\uff0c\u4f46\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u6709\u6240\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8bc4\u4ef7\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6821\u51c6\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u901a\u7528\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u914d\u65b9\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent studies empirically show that compressing reasoning steps into latent states, or implicit CoT compression, offers a token-efficient alternative. However, the mechanism behind CoT compression remains unclear. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the difficulty of learning to internalize intermediate reasoning steps. By introducing Order-r Interaction, we prove that the learning signal for high-order logical dependencies exponentially decays to solve irreducible problem, where skipping intermediate steps inevitably leads to high-order interaction barriers. To empirically validate this, we introduce NatBool-DAG, a challenging benchmark designed to enforce irreducible logical reasoning and eliminate semantic shortcuts. Guided by our theoretical findings, we propose ALiCoT (Aligned Implicit CoT), a novel framework that overcomes the signal decay by aligning latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states.

Despite its empirical success, CFG relies on a heuristic linear extrapolation that is often sensitive to the guidance scale. In this work, we provide a principled interpretation of CFG through the lens of optimization. We demonstrate that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, which guides latent variables toward the scaled target image set. This perspective reveals that the standard CFG formulation is an approximation of this gradient, where the prediction gap, the discrepancy between conditional and unconditional outputs, governs guidance sensitivity. Leveraging this insight, we reformulate the CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint. This formulation necessitates a manifold projection step, which we implement via an incremental gradient descent scheme during sampling. To improve computational efficiency and stability, we further enhance this iterative process with Anderson Acceleration without requiring additional model evaluations. Our proposed methods are training-free and consistently refine generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to the guidance scale.

To address the optimization instability of causal diffusion, we introduce a soft-tailed masking schema to preserve local context and a context-aware reweighting mechanism derived from signal-to-noise principles.

However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enables accelerated inference, thereby enabling more efficient long-horizon video generation.

These methods consume fewer tokens compared to the conventional language CoT reasoning and have the potential to plan in a dense latent space. However, current latent tokens are generally supervised based on imitating language labels. Considering that there can be multiple equivalent but diverse CoT labels for a question, passively imitating an arbitrary one may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies, undermining the potential planning ability and resulting in clear gaps between training and testing. In this work, we emphasize the importance of active planning over the representation space of latent tokens in achieving the optimal latent reasoning policy. So, we propose the \\underline{A}c\\underline{t}ive Latent \\underline{P}lanning method (ATP-Latent), which models the supervision process of latent tokens as a conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) to obtain a smoother latent space. Moreover, to facilitate the most reasonable latent reasoning policy, ATP-Latent conducts reinforcement learning (RL) with an auxiliary coherence reward, which is calculated based on the consistency between VAE-decoded contents of latent tokens, enabling a guided RL process. In experiments on LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1\\% accuracy and -3.3\\% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines.

Current defenses predominantly rely on the \"locality hypothesis\", suppressing isolated neurons or features. However, harmful semantics act as distributed, cross-layer circuits, rendering such localized interventions brittle and detrimental to utility. To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility.

This global-centric paradigm overlooks fine-grained interactions between local motion segments and individual body joints and text tokens, inevitably leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the pyramidal process of human motion perception (from joint dynamics to segment coherence, and finally to holistic comprehension) and propose a novel Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor (PST) learning framework for fine-grained motion-language retrieval. Specifically, the framework decomposes human motion into temporal segments and spatial body joints, and learns cross-modal correspondences through progressive joint-wise and segment-wise alignment in a pyramidal fashion, effectively capturing both local semantic details and hierarchical structural relationships.

However, we reveal a counterintuitive phenomenon: instruction following can paradoxically interfere with LLMs' task-solving capability. We propose a metric, SUSTAINSCORE, to quantify the interference of instruction following with task solving. It measures task performance drop after inserting into the instruction a self-evident constraint, which is naturally met by the original successful model output and extracted from it. Experiments on current LLMs in mathematics, multi-hop QA, and code generation show that adding the self-evident constraints leads to substantial performance drops, even for advanced models such as Claude-Sonnet-4.5. We validate the generality of the interference across constraint types and scales. Furthermore, we identify common failure patterns, and by investigating the mechanisms of interference, we observe that failed cases allocate significantly more attention to constraints compared to successful ones. Finally, we use SUSTAINSCORE to conduct an initial investigation into how distinct post-training paradigms affect the interference, presenting empirical observations on current alignment strategies.

Early-phase system validation under limited budgets mandates uncovering diverse failure mechanisms, rather than identifying a single worst-case document. We formalize this challenge as a Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) problem, aiming to identify complex interactions between document variables, with the objective to maximize the number of distinct failure types discovered within a fixed evaluation budget. Our methodology operates on a combinatorial space of document configurations, rendering instances of structural \\emph{risk features} to induce realistic failure conditions. We benchmark a diverse portfolio of search strategies spanning evolutionary, swarm-based, quality-diversity, learning-based, and quantum under identical budget constraints. Through configuration-level exclusivity, win-rate, and cross-temporal overlap analyses, we show that different solvers consistently uncover failure modes that remain undiscovered by specific alternatives at comparable budgets. Crucially, cross-temporal analysis reveals persistent solver-specific discoveries across all evaluated budgets, with no single strategy exhibiting absolute dominance. While the union of all solvers eventually recovers the observed failure space, reliance on any individual method systematically delays the discovery of important risks. These results demonstrate intrinsic solver complementarity and motivate portfolio-based SBST strategies for robust industrial IDP validation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u641c\u7d22\u57fa\u7840\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08SBST\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u6587\u6863\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u8bc6\u522b\u590d\u6742\u6587\u6863\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u5185\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u591a\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5bf9\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u6587\u6863\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u65e9\u671f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63ed\u793a\u591a\u79cd\u5931\u8d25\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6587\u6863\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u6863\u914d\u7f6e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u98ce\u9669\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bf1\u5bfc\u771f\u5b9e\u5931\u8d25\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u914d\u7f6e\u7ea7\u522b\u72ec\u5360\u6027\uff0c\u80dc\u7387\u548c\u8de8\u65f6\u533a\u91cd\u53e0\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u5185\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7edd\u5bf9\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u5185\u5728\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7IDP\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a8\u8350\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7ec4\u5408\u7684SBST\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

However, the capability of video aesthetic quality assessment, which is a fundamental ability for human, remains underexplored for LMMs. To address this, we introduce VideoAesBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LMMs' understanding of video aesthetic quality. VideoAesBench has several significant characteristics: (1) Diverse content including 1,804 videos from multiple video sources including user-generated (UGC), AI-generated (AIGC), compressed, robotic-generated (RGC), and game videos. (2) Multiple question formats containing traditional single-choice questions, multi-choice questions, True or False questions, and a novel open-ended questions for video aesthetics description. (3) Holistic video aesthetics dimensions including visual form related questions from 5 aspects, visual style related questions from 4 aspects, and visual affectiveness questions from 3 aspects.

While previous work has evaluated LLMs' understanding of figurative language in high-resource languages, their performance in low-resource languages remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MasalBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' contextual and cross-cultural understanding of Persian proverbs, which are a key component of conversation in this low-resource language. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs on MasalBench and find that they perform well in identifying Persian proverbs in context, achieving accuracies above 0.90. However, their performance drops considerably when tasked with identifying equivalent English proverbs, with the best model achieving 0.79 accuracy. Our findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in cultural knowledge and analogical reasoning, and they provide a framework for assessing cross-cultural understanding in other low-resource languages.

Frontier LLMs show over 40% accuracy variation depending solely on what is being counted - cities versus chemicals, names versus symbols. Controlled ablations rule out confounds. The gap is semantic, and it shifts unpredictably with small amounts of unrelated fine-tuning. LLMs do not implement algorithms; they approximate them, and the approximation is argument-dependent. As we show with an agentic example, this has implications beyond counting: any LLM function may carry hidden dependencies on the meaning of its inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "WhatCounts \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u524d\u6cbf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u968f\u8ba1\u6570\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u663e\u8457\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u52a0\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "method": "WhatCounts \u65b9\u6cd5\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u6216\u5206\u6563\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe40%\u3002\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Just noticeable difference (JND) characterizes the maximum imperceptible distortion for images under human or machine vision. Extending it to deep visual features naturally meets the above demand by providing a task-aligned tolerance boundary in feature space, offering a practical reference for controlling feature quality under constrained resources. We propose FeatJND, a task-aligned JND formulation that predicts the maximum tolerable per-feature perturbation map while preserving downstream task performance. We propose a FeatJND estimator at standardized split points and validate it across image classification, detection, and instance segmentation. Under matched distortion strength, FeatJND-based distortions consistently preserve higher task performance than unstructured Gaussian perturbations, and attribution visualizations suggest FeatJND can suppress non-critical feature regions. As an application, we further apply FeatJND to token-wise dynamic quantization and show that FeatJND-guided step-size allocation yields clear gains over random step-size permutation and global uniform step size under the same noise budget.

Existing efficient approaches often rely on complex additional training or external models for compression, which limits scalability and discards critical fine-grained information. In this paper, we propose VTC-R1, a new efficient reasoning paradigm that integrates vision-text compression into the reasoning process. Instead of processing lengthy textual traces, VTC-R1 renders intermediate reasoning segments into compact images, which are iteratively fed back into vision-language models as \"optical memory.\" We construct a training dataset based on OpenR1-Math-220K achieving 3.4x token compression and fine-tune representative VLMs-Glyph and Qwen3-VL. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as MATH500, AIME25, AMC23 and GPQA-D demonstrate that VTC-R1 consistently outperforms standard long-context reasoning. Furthermore, our approach significantly improves inference efficiency, achieving 2.7x speedup in end-to-end latency, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for reasoning-intensive applications.

However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior. Overall, SONIC-O1 provides an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded and socially robust multimodal understanding.

Thompson", "Haoteng Tang", "Liang Zhan"], "title": "Deep Models, Shallow Alignment: Uncovering the Granularity Mismatch in Neural Decoding", "comment": "29 pages, 13 figures", "summary": "Neural visual decoding is a central problem in brain computer interface research, aiming to reconstruct human visual perception and to elucidate the structure of neural representations. However, existing approaches overlook a fundamental granularity mismatch between human and machine vision, where deep vision models emphasize semantic invariance by suppressing local texture information, whereas neural signals preserve an intricate mixture of low-level visual attributes and high-level semantic content. To address this mismatch, we propose Shallow Alignment, a novel contrastive learning strategy that aligns neural signals with intermediate representations of visual encoders rather than their final outputs, thereby striking a better balance between low-level texture details and high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Shallow Alignment significantly outperforms standard final-layer alignment, with performance gains ranging from 22% to 58% across diverse vision backbones. Notably, our approach effectively unlocks the scaling law in neural visual decoding, enabling decoding performance to scale predictably with the capacity of pre-trained vision backbones. We further conduct systematic empirical analyses to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the observed performance gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u6d45\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6d45\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8622%\u523058%\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u589e\u957f\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u4e4b\u95f4\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6d88\u9664\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u795e\u7ecf\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u6d45\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b83\u5bf9\u9f50\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u800c\u975e\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6d45\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8622%\u523058%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b83\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0e\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u589e\u957f\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6d45\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity. We apply the framework to clinical information extraction (IE), which transforms patient narratives into structured medical entities and relations. Accuracy was assessed across five patient cohorts through comparisons with BERT models, and LLaMA-3 and DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o models. Evaluation settings included (1) in-domain training and testing, (2) external validation on independent cohorts, and (3) a low-resource new-site adaptation scenario using real-world clinical notes from the Yale New Haven Health System.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6b67\u4e49\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08Fed-MedLoRA\uff09\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\u6765\u6539\u5584\u8de8\u7ad9\u70b9\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u4e8eBERT\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e93\u739b\u62c9\u548cDeepspeech\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u901a\u4fe1/\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u671b\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4f20\u8f93\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u636e\u662f\u540c\u8d28\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5e76\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6709\u6548\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u5668\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6b67\u4e49\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08Fed-MedLoRA\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u5411\u91cf\u5c3a\u5bf8\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5730\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Fed-MedLoRA+\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e865\u4e2a\u60a3\u8005\u7fa4\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cFed-MedLoRA/Fed-MedLoRA+\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8eBERT\u3001LLaMA-3\u3001DeepSeek-R1\u548cGPT-4o\u7b49\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5373\u901a\u4fe1\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Existing defenses either rely on supervised signals or fail to generalize across diverse trigger types and modalities. In this work, we uncover a universal backdoor fingerprint-attention allocation divergence-where poisoned samples disrupt the balanced attention distribution across three functional components: system instructions, vision inputs, and user textual queries, regardless of trigger morphology. Motivated by this insight, we propose Tri-Component Attention Profiling (TCAP), an unsupervised defense framework to filter backdoor samples. TCAP decomposes cross-modal attention maps into the three components, identifies trigger-responsive attention heads via Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) statistical profiling, and isolates poisoned samples through EM-based vote aggregation. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and attack methods demonstrate that TCAP achieves consistently strong performance, establishing it as a robust and practical backdoor defense in MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u6307\u7eb9\u2014\u2014\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u914d\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u89e6\u53d1\u5f62\u6001\u5982\u4f55\uff0c\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6837\u672c\u5747\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u914d\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TCAP\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u89e6\u53d1\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eEM\u6295\u7968\u805a\u5408\u6392\u9664\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u62b5\u5fa1\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u89e6\u53d1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u6307\u7eb9\u6765\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6TCAP\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff08GMM\uff09\u7edf\u8ba1\u5256\u6790\u5206\u89e3\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5bf9\u89e6\u53d1\u6709\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528EM\uff08\u671f\u671b\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff09\u6295\u7968\u805a\u5408\u6765\u8fc7\u6ee4\u51fa\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5927\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5a01\u80c1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose Proactive Interactive Reasoning (PIR), a new reasoning paradigm that transforms LLMs from passive solvers into proactive inquirers that interleave reasoning with clarification. Unlike existing search- or tool-based frameworks that primarily address knowledge uncertainty by querying external environments, PIR targets premise- and intent-level uncertainty through direct interaction with the user. PIR is implemented via two core components: (1) an uncertainty-aware supervised fine-tuning procedure that equips models with interactive reasoning capability, and (2) a user-simulator-based policy optimization framework driven by a composite reward that aligns model behavior with user intent. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, code generation, and document editing demonstrate that PIR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 32.70\\% higher accuracy, 22.90\\% higher pass rate, and 41.36 BLEU improvement, while reducing nearly half of the reasoning computation and unnecessary interaction turns. Further reliability evaluations on factual knowledge, question answering, and missing-premise scenarios confirm the strong generalization and robustness of PIR.

However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting.

Existing robustness strategies either prune data or rely on costly prior quantification, failing to balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce DropoutTS, a model-agnostic plugin that shifts the paradigm from \"what\" to learn to \"how much\" to learn. DropoutTS employs a Sample-Adaptive Dropout mechanism: leveraging spectral sparsity to efficiently quantify instance-level noise via reconstruction residuals, it dynamically calibrates model learning capacity by mapping noise to adaptive dropout rates - selectively suppressing spurious fluctuations while preserving fine-grained fidelity. Extensive experiments across diverse noise regimes and open benchmarks show DropoutTS consistently boosts superior backbones' performance, delivering advanced robustness with negligible parameter overhead and no architectural modifications.

Some recent studies have shown that pre-trained softmax attention blocks can be converted into RNN blocks through parameter transfer and knowledge distillation. However, these transfer methods require substantial amounts of training data (more than 10B tokens), and the resulting hybrid models also exhibit poor long-context performance, which is the scenario where hybrid models enjoy significant inference speedups over Transformer-based models. In this paper, we present HALO (Hybrid Attention via Layer Optimization), a pipeline for distilling Transformer models into RNN-attention hybrid models. We then present HypeNet, a hybrid architecture with superior length generalization enabled by a novel position encoding scheme (named HyPE) and various architectural modifications.

We show this weakness stems from both sycophancy and inadequate ability to evaluate peer reliability. To address this, we first formalize the learning problem of history-aware reference, introducing the historical interactions of peers as additional input, so that agents can estimate peer reliability and learn from trustworthy peers when uncertain. This shifts the task from evaluating peer reasoning quality to estimating peer reliability based on interaction history. We then develop Epistemic Context Learning (ECL): a reasoning framework that conditions predictions on explicitly-built peer profiles from history. We further optimize ECL by reinforcement learning using auxiliary rewards. Our experiments reveal that our ECL enables small models like Qwen 3-4B to outperform a history-agnostic baseline 8x its size (Qwen 3-30B) by accurately identifying reliable peers. ECL also boosts frontier models to near-perfect (100%) performance.

However, existing NSR methods often suffer from geometric ambiguity and instability, particularly under sparse-view conditions. This issue is critical in large-scale urban remote sensing, where aerial image acquisition is limited by flight paths, terrain, and cost. To address this challenge, we present the first urban NSR framework that fuses 3D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) point clouds with aerial imagery for high-fidelity reconstruction under constrained, sparse-view settings. 3D SAR can efficiently capture large-scale geometry even from a single side-looking flight path, providing robust priors that complement photometric cues from images. Our framework integrates radar-derived spatial constraints into an SDF-based NSR backbone, guiding structure-aware ray selection and adaptive sampling for stable and efficient optimization. We also construct the first benchmark dataset with co-registered 3D SAR point clouds and aerial imagery, facilitating systematic evaluation of cross-modal 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that incorporating 3D SAR markedly enhances reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and robustness compared with single-modality baselines under highly sparse and oblique-view conditions, highlighting a viable route toward scalable high-fidelity urban reconstruction with advanced airborne and spaceborne optical-SAR sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u54083D\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\u96f7\u8fbe(SAR)\u70b9\u4e91\u548c\u822a\u7a7a\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u70b9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u70b9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57ce\u5e02\u9065\u611f\u4e2d\uff0c\u822a\u7a7a\u56fe\u50cf\u91c7\u96c6\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u98de\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u5730\u5f62\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c063D SAR\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u5230\u57fa\u4e8eSDF\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5c04\u7ebf\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u54083D SAR\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u659c\u89c6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u57ce\u5e02\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u673a\u8f7d\u548c\u661f\u8f7d\u5149\u5b66-SAR \u6210\u50cf\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

We introduce Metric Anything, a simple and scalable pretraining framework that learns metric depth from noisy, diverse 3D sources without manually engineered prompts, camera-specific modeling, or task-specific architectures. Central to our approach is the Sparse Metric Prompt, created by randomly masking depth maps, which serves as a universal interface that decouples spatial reasoning from sensor and camera biases. Using about 20M image-depth pairs spanning reconstructed, captured, and rendered 3D data across 10000 camera models, we demonstrate-for the first time-a clear scaling trend in the metric depth track. The pretrained model excels at prompt-driven tasks such as depth completion, super-resolution and Radar-camera fusion, while its distilled prompt-free student achieves state-of-the-art results on monocular depth estimation, camera intrinsics recovery, single/multi-view metric 3D reconstruction, and VLA planning.

We investigate this in the context of diffusion-based models that learn factorized latent spaces without factor-level supervision. In images, factors can capture background, illumination, and object attributes; in robotic videos, they can capture reusable motion components. To improve both latent factor discovery and quality of compositional generation, we introduce an adversarial training signal via a discriminator trained to distinguish between single-source samples and those generated by recombining factors across sources. By optimizing the generator to fool this discriminator, we encourage physical and semantic consistency in the resulting recombinations. Our method outperforms implementations of prior baselines on CelebA-HQ, Virtual KITTI, CLEVR, and Falcor3D, achieving lower FID scores and better disentanglement as measured by MIG and MCC.

However, constrained by the capacity of their internal world knowledge, prior work has proposed augmenting MLLMs by ``reasoning-then-tool-call'' for visual and textual search engines to obtain substantial gains on tasks requiring extensive factual information. However, these approaches typically define multimodal search in a naive setting, assuming that a single full-level or entity-level image query and few text query suffices to retrieve the key evidence needed to answer the question, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with substantial visual noise. Moreover, they are often limited in the reasoning depth and search breadth, making it difficult to solve complex questions that require aggregating evidence from diverse visual and textual sources. Building on this, we propose Vision-DeepResearch, which proposes one new multimodal deep-research paradigm, i.e., performs multi-turn, multi-entity and multi-scale visual and textual search to robustly hit real-world search engines under heavy noise. Our Vision-DeepResearch supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, while internalizing deep-research capabilities into the MLLM via cold-start supervision and RL training, resulting in a strong end-to-end multimodal deep-research MLLM. It substantially outperforming existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs, and workflows built on strong closed-source foundation model such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-4-Sonnet.

Despite its critical importance, automated recognition and feedback systems for ES training remain underexplored. To address this gap, this study proposes a unified, LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition benchmarked against conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and a pilot study on feedback generation. Within this framework, the Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the central reasoning module, performing both spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis from video data. Furthermore, the LLM is capable of verbalizing feedback in natural language, thereby translating complex technical insights into accessible, human-understandable guidance for trainees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20\\% in both accuracy and F1 score. Beyond recognition, the framework incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and explainable AI (XAI) principles, which provides automated, interpretable feedback highlighting correct actions and suggesting targeted improvements.

While integrating object detectors as prompt generators offers a pathway to automation, existing pipelines suffer from two fundamental limitations: objective mismatch, where detectors optimized for geometric localization do not correspond to the optimal prompting context required by SAM, and alignment overfitting in standard joint training, where the detector simply memorizes specific prompt adjustments for training samples rather than learning a generalizable policy. To bridge this gap, we introduce BLO-Inst, a unified framework that aligns detection and segmentation objectives by bi-level optimization. We formulate the alignment as a nested optimization problem over disjoint data splits. In the lower level, the SAM is fine-tuned to maximize segmentation fidelity given the current detection proposals on a subset ($D_1$). In the upper level, the detector is updated to generate bounding boxes that explicitly minimize the validation loss of the fine-tuned SAM on a separate subset ($D_2$). This effectively transforms the detector into a segmentation-aware prompt generator, optimizing the bounding boxes not just for localization accuracy, but for downstream mask quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BLO-Inst achieves superior performance, outperforming standard baselines on tasks in general and biomedical domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "BLO-Inst \u7b80\u4ecb\uff1aBLO-Inst \u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u5272\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0e Segment Anything Model (SAM) \u4e4b\u95f4\u56e0\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u6574\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u8c03 SAM \u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u6a21\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBLO-Inst \u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u8a00\uff1a\u524d\u8a00\u90e8\u5206\u6307\u51fa Segment Anything Model \u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u80fd\u529b\u867d\u7136\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u5f25\u5408\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aBLO-Inst \u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u5272\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5728\u5206\u79bb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5d4c\u5957\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0cSAM \u5728\u5f53\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5efa\u8bae\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u8c03\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5206\u5272\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u8f83\u9ad8\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u88ab\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u51cf\u5c0f\u4e86\u7ec6\u8c03\u540e\u7684 SAM \u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6210\u4e3a\u5206\u5272\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u4ee5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a9\u6a21\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBLO-Inst \u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1aBLO-Inst \u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u6a21\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing reference-based image generation methods leverage large-scale pretrained diffusion models and demonstrate strong capability in generating diverse images conditioned on a single reference image. However, these methods are limited to single-image references and cannot leverage 3D assets, constraining their practical versatility. To address this gap, we present a cross-domain diffusion model with dual-branch perception that leverages multi-view RGB images and point maps of 3D assets to jointly model their colors and canonical-space coordinates, achieving precise consistency between generated images and the 3D references. Our spatially aligned dual-branch generation architecture and domain-decoupled generation mechanism ensure the simultaneous generation of two spatially aligned but content-disentangled outputs, RGB images and point maps, linking 2D image attributes with 3D asset attributes. Experiments show that our approach effectively uses 3D assets as references to produce images consistent with the given assets, opening new possibilities for combining diffusion models with 3D content creation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c3D\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u56fe\u6765\u751f\u6210\u4e0e3D\u53c2\u8003\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53ea\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u5355\u5f20\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u75283D\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u548c3D\u8d44\u4ea7\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8de8\u57df\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u611f\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u89c6\u89d2RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c3D\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u56fe\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u989c\u8272\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e3D\u53c2\u8003\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u75283D\u8d44\u4ea7\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u8d44\u4ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57283D\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u76843D\u8d44\u4ea7\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

With the advent of Foundation Models (FMs), the field of AI-assisted ECG interpretation has begun to evolve, as they enable model reuse across different tasks by relying on embeddings. However, to responsibly employ FMs, it is crucial to rigorously assess to which extent the embeddings they produce are generalizable, particularly in error-sensitive domains such as healthcare. Although prior works have already addressed the problem of benchmarking ECG-expert FMs, they focus predominantly on the evaluation of downstream performance. To fill this gap, this study aims to find an in-depth, comprehensive benchmarking framework for FMs, with a specific focus on ECG-expert ones. To this aim, we introduce a benchmark methodology that complements performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis, leveraging SHAP and UMAP techniques. Furthermore, we rely on the methodology for carrying out an extensive evaluation of several ECG-expert FMs pretrained via state-of-the-art techniques over different cross-continental datasets and data availability settings; this includes ones featuring data scarcity, a fairly common situation in real-world medical scenarios.

Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u51b3\u7b56\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u51b5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5e93\u5b58\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u6ce8\u91cd\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ee9\u6548\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5305\u542b\u5408\u6210\u9700\u6c42\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5e93\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ee9\u6548\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6210\u672c-\u670d\u52a1\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6846\u67b6\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u7eaf\u7cb9\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8f6c\u5411\u64cd\u4f5c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a novel framework for creative generation using diffusion models, where creativity is associated with the inverse probability of an image's existence in the CLIP embedding space. Unlike prior approaches that rely on a manual blending of concepts or exclusion of subcategories, our method calculates the probability distribution of generated images and drives it towards low-probability regions to produce rare, imaginative, and visually captivating outputs.

Most existing debiasing methods adopt a suppressive paradigm by modifying parameters, prompts, or neurons associated with biased behavior; however, such approaches are often brittle, weakly generalizable, data-inefficient, and prone to degrading general capability. We propose \\textbf{KnowBias}, a lightweight and conceptually distinct framework that mitigates bias by strengthening, rather than suppressing, neurons encoding bias-knowledge. KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using a small set of bias-knowledge questions via attribution-based analysis, and selectively enhances them at inference time. This design enables strong debiasing while preserving general capabilities, generalizes across bias types and demographics, and is highly data efficient, requiring only a handful of simple yes/no questions and no retraining. Experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art debiasing performance with minimal utility degradation.

In such settings, outcome-based supervision is sparse and delayed, often rewarding incorrect trajectories and failing to support inference-time scaling. This motivates the use of Process Reward Models (WebPRMs) for web navigation, but existing approaches remain limited: scalar WebPRMs collapse progress into coarse, weakly grounded signals, while checklist-based WebPRMs rely on brittle template matching that fails under layout or semantic changes and often mislabels superficially correct actions as successful, providing little insight or interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce WebArbiter, a reasoning-first, principle-inducing WebPRM that formulates reward modeling as text generation, producing structured justifications that conclude with a preference verdict and identify the action most conducive to task completion under the current context. Training follows a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation equips the model with coherent principle-guided reasoning, and reinforcement learning corrects teacher biases by directly aligning verdicts with correctness, enabling stronger generalization. To support systematic evaluation, we release WebPRMBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning four diverse web environments with rich tasks and high-quality preference annotations. On WebPRMBench, WebArbiter-7B outperforms the strongest baseline, GPT-5, by 9.1 points.

Retrospective reviews of prediagnostic CT scans, when conducted by expert radiologists aware that the patient later developed PDAC, frequently reveal lesions that were previously overlooked. To help detecting these lesions earlier, we developed an automated system named ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence). It was trained on data from 1,598 patients from a single medical center. In the internal test involving 1,009 patients, ePAI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.939-0.999, a sensitivity of 95.3%, and a specificity of 98.7% for detecting small PDAC less than 2 cm in diameter, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 2 mm. In an external test involving 7,158 patients across 6 centers, ePAI achieved an AUC of 0.918-0.945, a sensitivity of 91.5%, and a specificity of 88.0%, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 5 mm. Importantly, ePAI detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans obtained 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis that had originally been overlooked by radiologists. It successfully detected and localized PDACs in 75 of 159 patients, with a median lead time of 347 days before clinical diagnosis. Our multi-reader study showed that ePAI significantly outperformed 30 board-certified radiologists by 50.3% (P < 0.05) in sensitivity while maintaining a comparable specificity of 95.4% in detecting PDACs early and prediagnostic. These findings suggest its potential of ePAI as an assistive tool to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e9\u671f\u80f0\u817a\u764c\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u80f0\u817a\u5bfc\u7ba1\u817a\u764c\uff08PDAC\uff09\u5728\u665a\u671f\u624d\u88ab\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u4e14\u9884\u540e\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u663e\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aePAI\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57f9\u8bad\u6765\u81ea\u5355\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\u5fc3\u76841,598\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e861,009\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5219\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u904d\u5e036\u4e2a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u76847,158\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u591a\u8bfb\u8005\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cePAI\u8fbe\u5230\u4e860.939-0.999\u7684AUC\uff0c95.3%\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c98.7%\u7684\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAUC\u4e3a0.918-0.945\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e3a91.5%\uff0c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e3a88.0%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u4e4b\u524d3\u523036\u4e2a\u6708\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u65e9\u671fPDAC\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e86159\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u768475\u540d\u65e9\u671fPDAC\uff0c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a347\u5929\u3002\u591a\u8bfb\u8005\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8868\u660e\uff0cePAI\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e30\u540d\u8ba4\u8bc1\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u5e08\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0895.4%\uff09\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0850.3%\uff0cP < 0.05\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cePAI\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u80f0\u817a\u764c\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u53d1\u73b0\u7387\u3002"}}

Existing attempts to bridge the synthetic-to-real gap for full-scene relighting remain suboptimal. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Physics-Inspired diffusion for full-image reLight ($\u03c0$-Light, or PI-Light), a two-stage framework that leverages physics-inspired diffusion models. Our design incorporates (i) batch-aware attention, which improves the consistency of intrinsic predictions across a collection of images, (ii) a physics-guided neural rendering module that enforces physically plausible light transport, (iii) physics-inspired losses that regularize training dynamics toward a physically meaningful landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability to real-world image editing, and (iv) a carefully curated dataset of diverse objects and scenes captured under controlled lighting conditions. Together, these components enable efficient finetuning of pretrained diffusion models while also providing a solid benchmark for downstream evaluation.

Project Page: https://sites.google.com/view/vi-probe/", "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often answer classic visual illusions \"correctly\" on original images, yet persist with the same responses when illusion factors are inverted, even though the visual change is obvious to humans. This raises a fundamental question: do VLMs perceive visual changes or merely recall memorized patterns? While several studies have noted this phenomenon, the underlying causes remain unclear. To move from observations to systematic understanding, this paper introduces VI-Probe, a controllable visual-illusion framework with graded perturbations and matched visual controls (without illusion inducer) that disentangles visually grounded perception from language-driven recall. Unlike prior work that focuses on averaged accuracy, we measure stability and sensitivity using Polarity-Flip Consistency, Template Fixation Index, and an illusion multiplier normalized against matched controls. Experiments across different families reveal that response persistence arises from heterogeneous causes rather than a single mechanism. For instance, GPT-5 exhibits memory override, Claude-Opus-4.1 shows perception-memory competition, while Qwen variants suggest visual-processing limits. Our findings challenge single-cause views and motivate probing-based evaluation that measures both knowledge and sensitivity to controlled visual change.

While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability. Experiments across four models and eight benchmarks show 2.19\\% and 4.63\\% improvements in-distribution and out-of-distribution respectively over standard methods, while reducing training time by 65-70% and token consumption by 50%, demonstrating that aligning post-training with human cognitive principles yields not only superior generalization but also enhanced training efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6CoMT-CCRL\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316LLM\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684LLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u540e\u8ddf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u7c7b\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0d\u826f\u548c\u4f4e\u6548\u3002", "method": "CoMT-CCRL\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u5148\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u4e0d\u6d89\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u6709\u81ea\u4fe1\u5fc3\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e862.19%\u548c4.63%\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8665-70%\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8650%\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5c06\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u539f\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

UEval comprises 1,000 expert-curated questions that require both images and text in the model output, sourced from 8 real-world tasks. Our curated questions cover a wide range of reasoning types, from step-by-step guides to textbook explanations. Evaluating open-ended multimodal generation is non-trivial, as simple LLM-as-a-judge methods can miss the subtleties. Different from previous works that rely on multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rate image quality or text accuracy, we design a rubric-based scoring system in UEval. For each question, reference images and text answers are provided to a MLLM to generate an initial rubric, consisting of multiple evaluation criteria, and human experts then refine and validate these rubrics. In total, UEval contains 10,417 validated rubric criteria, enabling scalable and fine-grained automatic scoring. UEval is challenging for current unified models: GPT-5-Thinking scores only 66.4 out of 100, while the best open-source model reaches merely 49.1. We observe that reasoning models often outperform non-reasoning ones, and transferring reasoning traces from a reasoning model to a non-reasoning model significantly narrows the gap.

However, traditional outcome-based RL approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, as coarse-grained scalar rewards fail to identify specific erroneous steps within long-horizon trajectories. This ambiguity frequently leads to \"process hallucinations\", where models reach correct answers through flawed logic or redundant retrieval steps. Although recent process-aware approaches attempt to mitigate this via static preference learning or heuristic reward shaping, they often lack the on-policy exploration capabilities required to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to integrate learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop. Our framework consists of four stages: (1) Supervised Policy Warmup to initialize the model with a structured reasoning format; (2) construction of an MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning quality; (3) PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement to align the policy with fine-grained process preferences; and (4) Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism. By aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals, ProRAG provides precise feedback for every action. Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks, validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision.

The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark. Results demonstrate that domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u80fd\u6548\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684AI\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u2018\u7eff\u8272AI\u2019\u5219\u5f3a\u8c03\u5c06\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u80fd\u6548\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u9886\u57df\u548c\u4e94\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e8632\u79cd\u9886\u57df\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u80fd\u91cf\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u80fd\u591f\u4f7f\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5728\u80fd\u6548\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6027\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u672a\u6765\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u80fd\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \\textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \\textbf{C}entralized \\textbf{C}ritic and \\textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \\textbf{D}ecentralized \\textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

We systematically study how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation across 24 LMs. Allowing neutrality and abstention during stated preference elicitation allows us to exclude weak signals, substantially improving Spearman's rank correlation ($\u03c1$) between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences. However, further allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives $\u03c1$ to near-zero or negative values due to high neutrality rates. Finally, we find that system prompt steering using stated preferences during revealed preference elicitation does not reliably improve SvR correlation on AIRiskDilemmas.

In sports, it is actively used for fine-grained analyses such as quantifying player contributions and identifying tactical patterns. However, the reliability of these models is fundamentally limited by inherent data quality issues that cause logical inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect event ordering or missing events). To this end, this study proposes VERSA (Verified Event Data Format for Reliable Soccer Analytics), a systematic verification framework that ensures the integrity of event stream data within the soccer domain. VERSA is based on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences, thereby enabling the automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns within the event stream data. Notably, our examination of event data from the K League 1 (2024 season), provided by Bepro, detected that 18.81% of all recorded events exhibited logical inconsistencies. Addressing such integrity issues, our experiments demonstrate that VERSA significantly enhances cross-provider consistency, ensuring stable and unified data representation across heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that data refined by VERSA significantly improves the robustness and performance of a downstream task called VAEP, which evaluates player contributions. These results highlight that the verification process is highly effective in increasing the reliability of data-driven analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "VERSATION\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8db3\u7403\u8d5b\u4e8b\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u4fdd\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u4e86\u8d5b\u4e8b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1VAEP\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u4f53\u80b2\u8d5b\u4e8b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5206\u6790\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u8d21\u732e\u548c\u6218\u672f\u6a21\u5f0f\u65f6\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014VERSATURATION\u3002", "method": "VERSATURATION\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u4e49\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e8f\u5217\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728K\u8054\u8d5b1\u76842024\u8d5b\u5b63\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cVERSATURATION\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38VAEP\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5b83\u68c0\u6d4b\u51fa18.81%\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b58\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u540e\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u88ab\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "conclusion": "VERSATURATION\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f53\u80b2\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4e3a\u8db3\u7403\u8d5b\u4e8b\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u52a0\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, for complex systems found in the real world, or when data already exist, defining the underlying environmental conditions is extremely challenging. This often results in an incomplete description of the environment in which the AI-based system must operate. Nevertheless, this description, called the Operational Design Domain (ODD), is required in many domains for the certification of AI-based systems. Traditionally, the ODD is created in the early stages of the development process, drawing on sophisticated expert knowledge and related standards. This paper presents a novel Safety-by-Design method to a posteriori define the ODD from previously collected data using a multi-dimensional kernel-based representation. This approach is validated through both Monte Carlo methods and a real-world aviation use case for a future safety-critical collision-avoidance system. Moreover, by defining under what conditions two ODDs are equal, the paper shows that the data-driven ODD can equal the original, underlying hidden ODD of the data. Utilizing the novel, Safe-by-Design kernel-based ODD enables future certification of data-driven, safety-critical AI-based systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6b64\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u7ef4\u6838\u8868\u793a\u4ece\u4e4b\u524d\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4e49\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57df\uff08ODD\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u822a\u7a7a\u6848\u4f8b\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952eAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u73af\u5883\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u6b64\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684ODD\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5df2\u6709\u6570\u636e\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\uff0c\u540e\u9a8c\u5b9a\u4e49ODD\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u8f85\u52a9AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8ba4\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u591a\u7ef4\u6838\u8868\u793a\u6280\u672f\u4ece\u5df2\u6709\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u540e\u9a8c\u5b9a\u4e49ODD\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2aODD\u76f8\u7b49\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u7ecf\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u822a\u7a7a\u6848\u4f8b\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684ODD\u53ef\u4ee5\u7b49\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u9690\u85cf\u7684ODD\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684Safety-by-Design\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49ODD\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952eAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}
