### [1] [Bi-Orthogonal Factor Decomposition for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05328)
*Fenil R. Doshi,Thomas Fel,Talia Konkle,George Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition (BFD) 方法，研究视网膜转换器中注意力机制之间的信息交换，发现注意力主要通过内容而非位置信息进行，揭示了不同注意力头的特化作用，并解释了DINOv2模型在整体形状处理上表现更优的原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对注意力机制的理解尚不全面，缺乏对信息交换机制的科学解释，BFD方法旨在填补这一空白。

Method: BFD采用两阶段分析框架：首先使用基于方差分析（ANOVA）的分解法将token激活值分离为位置因素和内容因素，其次使用查询-键（QK^T）矩阵的SVD揭示内容因素和位置因素如何促进信息交换。

Result: BFD分解首次清晰揭示了注意力机制主要通过内容而非位置信息进行信息交换，不同注意力头展示了内容-内容、内容-位置和位置-位置之间的特化作用，同时DINOv2模型通过在中间层同时保持位置结构和补充语义内容实现了优越的整体形状处理性能。

Conclusion: BFD方法为视网膜转换器机制提供了实用见解，揭示了信息交换的主要信息因素为内容而非位置，进一步理解注意力机制有助于优化和改进相关模型的性能。

Abstract: Self-attention is the central computational primitive of Vision Transformers, yet we lack a principled understanding of what information attention mechanisms exchange between tokens. Attention maps describe where weight mass concentrates; they do not reveal whether queries and keys trade position, content, or both. We introduce Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition (BFD), a two-stage analytical framework: first, an ANOVA-based decomposition statistically disentangles token activations into orthogonal positional and content factors; second, SVD of the query-key interaction matrix QK^T exposes bi-orthogonal modes that reveal how these factors mediate communication. After validating proper isolation of position and content, we apply BFD to state-of-the-art vision models and uncover three phenomena.(i) Attention operates primarily through content. Content-content interactions dominate attention energy, followed by content-position coupling. DINOv2 allocates more energy to content-position than supervised models and distributes computation across a richer mode spectrum. (ii) Attention mechanisms exhibit specialization: heads differentiate into content-content, content-position, and position-position operators, while singular modes within heads show analogous specialization. (iii) DINOv2's superior holistic shape processing emerges from intermediate layers that simultaneously preserve positional structure while contextually enriching semantic content.
  Overall, BFD exposes how tokens interact through attention and which informational factors - positional or semantic - mediate their communication, yielding practical insights into vision transformer mechanisms.

TL;DR: 这项研究探讨了Vision Language Models (VLMs)通过Im2Sim方法识别和模拟图像中所示系统及其机制的能力。研究结果显示，领先VLMs能够理解并建模复杂多组件系统，但对细节的模拟能力有限。


<details>

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索VLMs在理解和模拟图像中的复杂系统方面的潜力及局限，揭示VLMs在高层次视觉理解与细节感知之间的不对称性。

Method: 研究采用了Im2Sim方法，给定真实的自然图像，要求VLMs描述系统并编写生成该系统的代码。生成的代码被执行以生成合成图像，最终与原图像进行比较。

Result: 研究结果表明，领先的VLMs如GPT和Gemini能够在多个抽象层次上理解和建模多种领域的复杂多组件系统，但对图像中的细微细节和模式细节的再现能力有限。

Conclusion: 结论是，VLMs展示了对复杂系统高层次理解的能力，但在细节感知方面存在限制。这一结果揭示了VLMs在高层次视觉理解和细节感知之间的有趣的不对称性。

Abstract: The ability to construct mental models of the world is a central aspect of understanding. Similarly, visual understanding can be viewed as the ability to construct a representative model of the system depicted in an image. This work explores the capacity of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to recognize and simulate the systems and mechanisms depicted in images using the Im2Sim methodology. The VLM is given a natural image of a real-world system (e.g., cities, clouds, vegetation) and is tasked with describing the system and writing code that simulates and generates it. This generative code is then executed to produce a synthetic image, which is compared against the original. This approach is tested on various complex emergent systems, ranging from physical systems (waves, lights, clouds) to vegetation, cities, materials, and geological formations. Through analysis of the models and images generated by the VLMs, we examine their understanding of the systems in images. The results show that leading VLMs (GPT, Gemini) demonstrate the capacity to understand and model complex, multi-component systems across multiple layers of abstraction and a wide range of domains. At the same time, the VLMs exhibit limited ability to replicate fine details and low-level arrangements of patterns in the image. These findings reveal an interesting asymmetry: VLMs combine high-level, deep visual understanding of images with limited perception of fine details.

Abstract: Recent advancements in lightweight neural networks have significantly improved the efficiency of deploying deep learning models on edge hardware. However, most existing architectures still trade accuracy for latency, which limits their applicability on microcontroller and neural processing unit based devices. In this work, we introduce two new model families, STResNet for image classification and STYOLO for object detection, jointly optimized for accuracy, efficiency, and memory footprint on resource constrained platforms. The proposed STResNet series, ranging from Nano to Tiny variants, achieves competitive ImageNet 1K accuracy within a four million parameter budget. Specifically, STResNetMilli attains 70.0 percent Top 1 accuracy with only three million parameters, outperforming MobileNetV1 and ShuffleNetV2 at comparable computational complexity. For object detection, STYOLOMicro and STYOLOMilli achieve 30.5 percent and 33.6 percent mean average precision, respectively, on the MS COCO dataset, surpassing YOLOv5n and YOLOX Nano in both accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, when STResNetMilli is used as a backbone with the Ultralytics training environment.

Abstract: We present MOSAIC-GS, a novel, fully explicit, and computationally efficient approach for high-fidelity dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular videos using Gaussian Splatting. Monocular reconstruction is inherently ill-posed due to the lack of sufficient multiview constraints, making accurate recovery of object geometry and temporal coherence particularly challenging. To address this, we leverage multiple geometric cues, such as depth, optical flow, dynamic object segmentation, and point tracking. Combined with rigidity-based motion constraints, these cues allow us to estimate preliminary 3D scene dynamics during an initialization stage. Recovering scene dynamics prior to the photometric optimization reduces reliance on motion inference from visual appearance alone, which is often ambiguous in monocular settings. To enable compact representations, fast training, and real-time rendering while supporting non-rigid deformations, the scene is decomposed into static and dynamic components. Each Gaussian in the dynamic part of the scene is assigned a trajectory represented as time-dependent Poly-Fourier curve for parameter-efficient motion encoding. We demonstrate that MOSAIC-GS achieves substantially faster optimization and rendering compared to existing methods, while maintaining reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art approaches across standard monocular dynamic scene benchmarks.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of breast cancer is crucial for improving survival rates. Radiomics and deep learning (DL) have shown significant potential in assisting radiologists with early cancer detection. This paper aims to critically assess the performance of radiomics, DL, and ensemble techniques in detecting cancer from screening mammograms. Two independent datasets were used: the RSNA 2023 Breast Cancer Detection Challenge (11,913 patients) and a Mexican cohort from the TecSalud dataset (19,400 patients). The ConvNeXtV1-small DL model was trained on the RSNA dataset and validated on the TecSalud dataset, while radiomics models were developed using the TecSalud dataset and validated with a leave-one-year-out approach. The ensemble method consistently combined and calibrated predictions using the same methodology. Results showed that the ensemble approach achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87, compared to 0.83 for ConvNeXtV1-small and 0.80 for radiomics. In conclusion, ensemble methods combining DL and radiomics predictions significantly enhance breast cancer diagnosis from mammograms.

*Vladimir Frants,Sos Agaian,Karen Panetta*

TL;DR: EdgeLDR 是一种将Quaternion通道混合与Block-circulant参数结构结合的框架，通过FFT实现高效计算，适用于边缘设备上的深度学习模型部署。

Motivation: 针对深度学习在边缘设备上的内存交通和计算成本限制，提出EdgeLDR框架以减少参数量和提高计算效率。

Method: 利用Quaternion表示和Block-circulant结构，结合FFT方法，开发适用于边缘设备的高效Quaternion线性层和卷积层。

Result: EdgeLDR 实现了显著的参数压缩，且在不同任务上保持了具有竞争力的准确率。通过FFT计算带来了显著的速度提升，特别是在较大的块尺寸下。

Conclusion: EdgeLDR框架为深度学习在边缘设备上的应用提供了一种有效的方法，尤其是在计算资源受限的环境下。

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on edge devices is often limited by the memory traffic and compute cost of dense linear operators. While quaternion neural networks improve parameter efficiency by coupling multiple channels through Hamilton products, they typically retain unstructured dense weights; conversely, structured matrices enable fast computation but are usually applied in the real domain. This paper introduces EdgeLDR, a practical framework for quaternion block-circulant linear and convolutional layers that combines quaternion channel mixing with block-circulant parameter structure and enables FFT-based evaluation through the complex adjoint representation. We present reference implementations of EdgeLDR layers and compare FFT-based computation against a naive spatial-domain realization of quaternion circulant products. FFT evaluation yields large empirical speedups over the naive implementation and keeps latency stable as block size increases, making larger compression factors computationally viable. We further integrate EdgeLDR layers into compact CNN and Transformer backbones and evaluate accuracy-compression trade-offs on 32x32 RGB classification (CIFAR-10/100, SVHN) and hyperspectral image classification (Houston 2013, Pavia University), reporting parameter counts and CPU/GPU latency. The results show that EdgeLDR layers provide significant compression with competitive accuracy.

Abstract: The image geolocalization task aims to predict the location where an image was taken anywhere on Earth using visual clues. Existing large vision-language model (LVLM) approaches leverage world knowledge, chain-of-thought reasoning, and agentic capabilities, but overlook a common strategy used by humans -- using maps. In this work, we first equip the model \textit{Thinking with Map} ability and formulate it as an agent-in-the-map loop. We develop a two-stage optimization scheme for it, including agentic reinforcement learning (RL) followed by parallel test-time scaling (TTS). The RL strengthens the agentic capability of model to improve sampling efficiency, and the parallel TTS enables the model to explore multiple candidate paths before making the final prediction, which is crucial for geolocalization. To evaluate our method on up-to-date and in-the-wild images, we further present MAPBench, a comprehensive geolocalization training and evaluation benchmark composed entirely of real-world images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing open- and closed-source models on most metrics, specifically improving Acc@500m from 8.0\% to 22.1\% compared to \textit{Gemini-3-Pro} with Google Search/Map grounded mode.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) remains a long-standing challenge due to weak signal contrast, limited spatial extent, and cluttered backgrounds. Despite performance improvements from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), current models lack a mechanism to trace how small targets trigger directional, layer-wise perturbations in the feature space, which is an essential cue for distinguishing signal from structured noise in infrared scenes. To address this limitation, we propose the Trajectory-Aware Mamba Propagation Network (TAPM-Net), which explicitly models the spatial diffusion behavior of target-induced feature disturbances. TAPM-Net is built upon two novel components: a Perturbation-guided Path Module (PGM) and a Trajectory-Aware State Block (TASB). The PGM constructs perturbation energy fields from multi-level features and extracts gradient-following feature trajectories that reflect the directionality of local responses. The resulting feature trajectories are fed into the TASB, a Mamba-based state-space unit that models dynamic propagation along each trajectory while incorporating velocity-constrained diffusion and semantically aligned feature fusion from word-level and sentence-level embeddings. Unlike existing attention-based methods, TAPM-Net enables anisotropic, context-sensitive state transitions along spatial trajectories while maintaining global coherence at low computational cost. Experiments on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1K demonstrate that TAPM-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in ISTD.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The efficacy of Multimodal Transformers in visually-rich document understanding (VrDU) is critically constrained by two inherent limitations: the lack of explicit modeling for logical reading order and the interference of visual tokens that dilutes attention on textual semantics.
  To address these challenges, this paper presents ROAP, a lightweight and architecture-agnostic pipeline designed to optimize attention distributions in Layout Transformers without altering their pre-trained backbones.
  The proposed pipeline first employs an Adaptive-XY-Gap (AXG-Tree) to robustly extract hierarchical reading sequences from complex layouts. These sequences are then integrated into the attention mechanism via a Reading-Order-Aware Relative Position Bias (RO-RPB). Furthermore, a Textual-Token Sub-block Attention Prior (TT-Prior) is introduced to adaptively suppress visual noise and enhance fine-grained text-text interactions.
  Extensive experiments on the FUNSD and CORD benchmarks demonstrate that ROAP consistently improves the performance of representative backbones, including LayoutLMv3 and GeoLayoutLM.
  These findings confirm that explicitly modeling reading logic and regulating modality interference are critical for robust document understanding, offering a scalable solution for complex layout analysis. The implementation code will be released at https://github.com/KevinYuLei/ROAP.

Abstract: Understanding plant root systems is critical for advancing research in soil-plant interactions, nutrient uptake, and overall plant health. However, accurate imaging of roots in subterranean environments remains a persistent challenge due to adverse conditions such as occlusion, varying soil moisture, and inherently low contrast, which limit the effectiveness of conventional vision-based approaches. In this work, we propose a novel underground imaging system that captures multiple overlapping views of plant roots and integrates a deep learning-based Multi-Image Super Resolution (MISR) framework designed to enhance root visibility and detail. To train and evaluate our approach, we construct a synthetic dataset that simulates realistic underground imaging scenarios, incorporating key environmental factors that affect image quality. Our proposed MISR algorithm leverages spatial redundancy across views to reconstruct high-resolution images with improved structural fidelity and visual clarity. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art super resolution baselines, achieving a 2.3 percent reduction in BRISQUE, indicating improved image quality with the same CLIP-IQA score, thereby enabling enhanced phenotypic analysis of root systems. This, in turn, facilitates accurate estimation of critical root traits, including root hair count and root hair density. The proposed framework presents a promising direction for robust automatic underground plant root imaging and trait quantification for agricultural and ecological research.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are associated with progressive gray matter loss, particularly in medial temporal structures. In this study, CAT12/SPM12 voxel-based morphometry was applied to baseline T1-weighted MRI scans from 249 ADNI participants (CN = 90, MCI = 129, AD = 30). Gray matter volume was analyzed using a general linear model, with the diagnostic group as primary predictor and age and total intracranial volume as covariates. Statistical maps were thresholded at p < 0.001 (voxelwise) and corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level using family-wise error (FWE) correction (p < 0.05). Significant hippocampal atrophy was observed in AD relative to CN and MCI (Cohen's d = 2.03 and 1.61, respectively). Hippocampal volume demonstrated moderate predictive value for conversion from MCI to AD (AUC = 0.66). Stratification by APOE4 status did not reveal significant genetic effects on cross-sectional hippocampal volume. These results support medial temporal degeneration as a key feature of AD progression and provide insights into predictive biomarkers and genetic influences.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Long videos, ranging from minutes to hours, present significant challenges for current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to their complex events, diverse scenes, and long-range dependencies. Direct encoding of such videos is computationally too expensive, while simple video-to-text conversion often results in redundant or fragmented content. To address these limitations, we introduce MMViR, a novel multi-modal, multi-grained structured representation for long video understanding. MMViR identifies key turning points to segment the video and constructs a three-level description that couples global narratives with fine-grained visual details. This design supports efficient query-based retrieval and generalizes well across various scenarios. Extensive evaluations across three tasks, including QA, summarization, and retrieval, show that MMViR outperforms the prior strongest method, achieving a 19.67% improvement in hour-long video understanding while reducing processing latency to 45.4% of the original.

Abstract: Accurate tumor segmentation and classification in breast ultrasound (BUS) imaging remain challenging due to low contrast, speckle noise, and diverse lesion morphology. This study presents a multi-task deep learning framework that jointly performs lesion segmentation and diagnostic classification using embeddings from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) vision encoder. Unlike prompt-based SAM variants, our approach employs a prompt-free, fully supervised adaptation where high-dimensional SAM features are decoded through either a lightweight convolutional head or a UNet-inspired decoder for pixel-wise segmentation. The classification branch is enhanced via mask-guided attention, allowing the model to focus on lesion-relevant features while suppressing background artifacts. Experiments on the PRECISE 2025 breast ultrasound dataset, split per class into 80 percent training and 20 percent testing, show that the proposed method achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.887 and an accuracy of 92.3 percent, ranking among the top entries on the PRECISE challenge leaderboard. These results demonstrate that SAM-based representations, when coupled with segmentation-guided learning, significantly improve both lesion delineation and diagnostic prediction in breast ultrasound imaging.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Hieroglyphs, as logographic writing systems, encode rich semantic and cultural information within their internal structural composition. Yet, current advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) usually remain structurally blind to this information. LLMs process characters as textual tokens, while MLLMs additionally view them as raw pixel grids. Both fall short to model the underlying logic of character strokes. Furthermore, existing structural analysis methods are often script-specific and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose Hieroglyphic Stroke Analyzer (HieroSA), a novel and generalizable framework that enables MLLMs to automatically derive stroke-level structures from character bitmaps without handcrafted data. It transforms modern logographic and ancient hieroglyphs character images into explicit, interpretable line-segment representations in a normalized coordinate space, allowing for cross-lingual generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HieroSA effectively captures character-internal structures and semantics, bypassing the need for language-specific priors. Experimental results highlight the potential of our work as a graphematics analysis tool for a deeper understanding of hieroglyphic scripts. View our code at https://github.com/THUNLP-MT/HieroSA.

Abstract: We introduce GaussianSwap, a novel video face swapping framework that constructs a 3D Gaussian Splatting based face avatar from a target video while transferring identity from a source image to the avatar. Conventional video swapping frameworks are limited to generating facial representations in pixel-based formats. The resulting swapped faces exist merely as a set of unstructured pixels without any capacity for animation or interactive manipulation. Our work introduces a paradigm shift from conventional pixel-based video generation to the creation of high-fidelity avatar with swapped faces. The framework first preprocesses target video to extract FLAME parameters, camera poses and segmentation masks, and then rigs 3D Gaussian splats to the FLAME model across frames, enabling dynamic facial control. To ensure identity preserving, we propose an compound identity embedding constructed from three state-of-the-art face recognition models for avatar finetuning. Finally, we render the face-swapped avatar on the background frames to obtain the face-swapped video. Experimental results demonstrate that GaussianSwap achieves superior identity preservation, visual clarity and temporal consistency, while enabling previously unattainable interactive applications.

Abstract: Video-based Person Re-IDentification (VPReID) aims to retrieve the same person from videos captured by non-overlapping cameras. At extreme far distances, VPReID is highly challenging due to severe resolution degradation, drastic viewpoint variation and inevitable appearance noise. To address these issues, we propose a Scale-Adaptive framework with Shape Priors for VPReID, named SAS-VPReID. The framework is built upon three complementary modules. First, we deploy a Memory-Enhanced Visual Backbone (MEVB) to extract discriminative feature representations, which leverages the CLIP vision encoder and multi-proxy memory. Second, we propose a Multi-Granularity Temporal Modeling (MGTM) to construct sequences at multiple temporal granularities and adaptively emphasize motion cues across scales. Third, we incorporate Prior-Regularized Shape Dynamics (PRSD) to capture body structure dynamics. With these modules, our framework can obtain more discriminative feature representations. Experiments on the VReID-XFD benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of each module and our final framework ranks the first on the VReID-XFD challenge leaderboard. The source code is available at https://github.com/YangQiWei3/SAS-VPReID.

Abstract: Multi-modal image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from multiple source images to produce high-quality fused images with enriched content. Although existing approaches based on state space model have achieved satisfied performance with high computational efficiency, they tend to either over-prioritize infrared intensity at the cost of visible details, or conversely, preserve visible structure while diminishing thermal target salience. To overcome these challenges, we propose DIFF-MF, a novel difference-driven channel-spatial state space model for multi-modal image fusion. Our approach leverages feature discrepancy maps between modalities to guide feature extraction, followed by a fusion process across both channel and spatial dimensions. In the channel dimension, a channel-exchange module enhances channel-wise interaction through cross-attention dual state space modeling, enabling adaptive feature reweighting. In the spatial dimension, a spatial-exchange module employs cross-modal state space scanning to achieve comprehensive spatial fusion. By efficiently capturing global dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity, DIFF-MF effectively integrates complementary multi-modal features. Experimental results on the driving scenarios and low-altitude UAV datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both visual quality and quantitative evaluation.

Abstract: Existing multi-object image generation methods face difficulties in achieving precise alignment between localized image generation regions and their corresponding semantics based on language descriptions, frequently resulting in inconsistent object quantities and attribute aliasing. To mitigate this limitation, mainstream approaches typically rely on external control signals to explicitly constrain the spatial layout, local semantic and visual attributes of images. However, this strong dependency makes the input format rigid, rendering it incompatible with the heterogeneous resource conditions of users and diverse constraint requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MoGen, a user-friendly multi-object image generation method. First, we design a Regional Semantic Anchor (RSA) module that precisely anchors phrase units in language descriptions to their corresponding image regions during the generation process, enabling text-to-image generation that follows quantity specifications for multiple objects. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce an Adaptive Multi-modal Guidance (AMG) module, which adaptively parses and integrates various combinations of multi-source control signals to formulate corresponding structured intent. This intent subsequently guides selective constraints on scene layouts and object attributes, achieving dynamic fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that MoGen significantly outperforms existing methods in generation quality, quantity consistency, and fine-grained control, while exhibiting superior accessibility and control flexibility.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in multimodal tasks, but remain susceptible to hallucinations, where generated text deviates from the underlying visual content. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily rely on output logits or external verification tools, often overlooking their internal mechanisms. In this work, we investigate the outputs of internal attention heads, postulating that specific heads carry the primary signals for truthful generation.However, directly probing these high-dimensional states is challenging due to the entanglement of visual-linguistic syntax and noise. To address this, we propose VIB-Probe, a novel hallucination detection and mitigation framework leveraging the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) theory. Our method extracts discriminative patterns across layers and heads while filtering out semantic nuisances through the information bottleneck principle. Furthermore, by leveraging the gradients of our VIB probe, we identify attention heads with strong causal influence on hallucinations and introduce an inference-time intervention strategy for hallucination mitigation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that VIB-Probe significantly outperforms existing baselines in both settings. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Universal visual anomaly detection (AD) aims to identify anomaly images and segment anomaly regions towards open and dynamic scenarios, following zero- and few-shot paradigms without any dataset-specific fine-tuning. We have witnessed significant progress in widely use of visual-language foundational models in recent approaches. However, current methods often struggle with complex prompt engineering, elaborate adaptation modules, and challenging training strategies, ultimately limiting their flexibility and generality. To address these issues, this paper rethinks the fundamental mechanism behind visual-language models for AD and presents an embarrassingly simple, general, and effective framework for Universal vision Anomaly Detection (UniADet). Specifically, we first find language encoder is used to derive decision weights for anomaly classification and segmentation, and then demonstrate that it is unnecessary for universal AD. Second, we propose an embarrassingly simple method to completely decouple classification and segmentation, and decouple cross-level features, i.e., learning independent weights for different tasks and hierarchical features. UniADet is highly simple (learning only decoupled weights), parameter-efficient (only 0.002M learnable parameters), general (adapting a variety of foundation models), and effective (surpassing state-of-the-art zero-/few-shot by a large margin and even full-shot AD methods for the first time) on 14 real-world AD benchmarks covering both industrial and medical domains. We will make the code and model of UniADet available at https://github.com/gaobb/UniADet.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition is a key task in human-computer interaction and affective computing. However, acquiring a large amount of labeled facial expression data is often costly. Therefore, it is particularly important to design a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm that makes full use of both labeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm based on Dynamic Threshold Adjustment (DTA) and Selective Negative Learning (SNL). Initially, we designed strategies for local attention enhancement and random dropout of feature maps during feature extraction, which strengthen the representation of local features while ensuring the model does not overfit to any specific local area. Furthermore, this study introduces a dynamic thresholding method to adapt to the requirements of the semi-supervised learning framework for facial expression recognition tasks, and through a selective negative learning strategy, it fully utilizes unlabeled samples with low confidence by mining useful expression information from complementary labels, achieving impressive results. We have achieved state-of-the-art performance on the RAF-DB and AffectNet datasets. Our method surpasses fully supervised methods even without using the entire dataset, which proves the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Even when factually correct, social-media news previews (image-headline pairs) can induce interpretation drift: by selectively omitting crucial context, they lead readers to form judgments that diverge from what the full article conveys. This covert harm is harder to detect than explicit misinformation yet remains underexplored. To address this gap, we develop a multi-stage pipeline that disentangles and simulates preview-based versus context-based understanding, enabling construction of the MM-Misleading benchmark. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate open-source LVLMs and uncover pronounced blind spots to omission-based misleadingness detection. We further propose OMGuard, which integrates (1) Interpretation-Aware Fine-Tuning, which used to improve multimodal misleadingness detection and (2) Rationale-Guided Misleading Content Correction, which uses explicit rationales to guide headline rewriting and reduce misleading impressions. Experiments show that OMGuard lifts an 8B model's detection accuracy to match a 235B LVLM and delivers markedly stronger end-to-end correction. Further analysis reveals that misleadingness typically stems from local narrative shifts (e.g., missing background) rather than global frame changes, and identifies image-driven scenarios where text-only correction fails, highlighting the necessity of visual interventions.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) integrate multimodal understanding and generation, yet they are limited to maintaining visual consistency and disambiguating visual cues when referencing details across multiple input images. In this work, we propose a scalable multi-image editing framework for UMMs that explicitly distinguishes image identities and generalizes to variable input counts. Algorithmically, we introduce two innovations: 1) The learnable latent separators explicitly differentiate each reference image in the latent space, enabling accurate and disentangled conditioning. 2) The sinusoidal index encoding assigns visual tokens from the same image a continuous sinusoidal index embedding, which provides explicit image identity while allowing generalization and extrapolation on a variable number of inputs. To facilitate training and evaluation, we establish a high-fidelity benchmark using an inverse dataset construction methodology to guarantee artifact-free, achievable outputs. Experiments show clear improvements in semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and cross-image integration over prior baselines on diverse multi-image editing tasks, validating our advantages on consistency and generalization ability.

Abstract: This work presents Orient Anything V2, an enhanced foundation model for unified understanding of object 3D orientation and rotation from single or paired images. Building upon Orient Anything V1, which defines orientation via a single unique front face, V2 extends this capability to handle objects with diverse rotational symmetries and directly estimate relative rotations. These improvements are enabled by four key innovations: 1) Scalable 3D assets synthesized by generative models, ensuring broad category coverage and balanced data distribution; 2) An efficient, model-in-the-loop annotation system that robustly identifies 0 to N valid front faces for each object; 3) A symmetry-aware, periodic distribution fitting objective that captures all plausible front-facing orientations, effectively modeling object rotational symmetry; 4) A multi-frame architecture that directly predicts relative object rotations. Extensive experiments show that Orient Anything V2 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on orientation estimation, 6DoF pose estimation, and object symmetry recognition across 11 widely used benchmarks. The model demonstrates strong generalization, significantly broadening the applicability of orientation estimation in diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: The malicious misuse and widespread dissemination of AI-generated images pose a significant threat to the authenticity of online information. Current detection methods often struggle to generalize to unseen generative models, and the rapid evolution of generative techniques continuously exacerbates this challenge. Without adaptability, detection models risk becoming ineffective in real-world applications. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel three-stage domain continual learning framework designed for continuous adaptation to evolving generative models. In the first stage, we employ a strategic parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to develop a transferable offline detection model with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, the second stage integrates unseen data streams into a continual learning process. To efficiently learn from limited samples of novel generated models and mitigate overfitting, we design a data augmentation chain with progressively increasing complexity. Furthermore, we leverage the Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) method to approximate the Hessian and alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Finally, the third stage utilizes a linear interpolation strategy based on Linear Mode Connectivity, effectively capturing commonalities across diverse generative models and further enhancing overall performance. We establish a comprehensive benchmark of 27 generative models, including GANs, deepfakes, and diffusion models, chronologically structured up to August 2024 to simulate real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our initial offline detectors surpass the leading baseline by +5.51% in terms of mean average precision. Our continual learning strategy achieves an average accuracy of 92.20%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In the field of 3D dynamic scene reconstruction, how to balance model convergence rate and rendering quality has long been a critical challenge that urgently needs to be addressed, particularly in high-precision modeling of scenes with complex dynamic motions. To tackle this issue, this study proposes the GS-DMSR method. By quantitatively analyzing the dynamic evolution process of Gaussian attributes, this mechanism achieves adaptive gradient focusing, enabling it to dynamically identify significant differences in the motion states of Gaussian models. It then applies differentiated optimization strategies to Gaussian models with varying degrees of significance, thereby significantly improving the model convergence rate. Additionally, this research integrates a multi-scale manifold enhancement module, which leverages the collaborative optimization of an implicit nonlinear decoder and an explicit deformation field to enhance the modeling efficiency for complex deformation scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves a frame rate of up to 96 FPS on synthetic datasets, while effectively reducing both storage overhead and training time.Our code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GS-DMSR-2212.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known to exhibit a strong texture bias, favoring local patterns over global shape information--a tendency inherent to their convolutional architecture. While this bias is beneficial for texture-rich natural images, it often degrades performance on shape-dominant data such as illustrations and sketches. Although prior work has proposed shape-biased models to mitigate this issue, these approaches lack a quantitative metric for identifying which datasets would actually benefit from such modifications. To address this gap, we propose a data-driven metric that quantifies the shape-texture balance of a dataset by computing the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between each image's luminance channel and its L0-smoothed counterpart. Building on this metric, we further introduce a computationally efficient adaptation method that promotes shape bias by modifying the dilation of max-pooling operations while keeping convolutional weights frozen. Experimental results show that this approach consistently improves classification accuracy on shape-dominant datasets, particularly in low-data regimes where full fine-tuning is impractical, requiring training only the final classification layer.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models often struggle with faithful reasoning in complex visual scenes, where intricate entities and relations require precise visual grounding at each step. This reasoning unfaithfulness frequently manifests as hallucinated entities, mis-grounded relations, skipped steps, and over-specified reasoning. Existing preference-based approaches, typically relying on textual perturbations or answer-conditioned rationales, fail to address this challenge as they allow models to exploit language priors to bypass visual grounding. To address this, we propose SceneAlign, a framework that leverages scene graphs as structured visual information to perform controllable structural interventions. By identifying reasoning-critical nodes and perturbing them through four targeted strategies that mimic typical grounding failures, SceneAlign constructs hard negative rationales that remain linguistically plausible but are grounded in inaccurate visual facts. These contrastive pairs are used in Direct Preference Optimization to steer models toward fine-grained, structure-faithful reasoning. Across seven visual reasoning benchmarks, SceneAlign consistently improves answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, highlighting the effectiveness of grounding-aware alignment for multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 大多数步态模型试图在数据驱动的方式下隐式学习不同步态条件下的共性特征，以使不同步态条件下的特征更接近以利于识别，但较少有研究明确探究不同步态条件之间的内在联系。为此，本文提出了一种基于几何变换的学习方法，通过解耦几何变化与身份信息，实现对不同步态条件的处理。

Method: 本文通过探索三种常见的几何变换（反射、旋转、缩放），设计了一个反映-旋转-缩放几何不变性学习框架（$	extbf{RRS}$-步态），该框架首先根据特定的几何变换灵活调整卷积核以实现特征的近似等变性，然后将这三个等变特征分别送入全局池化操作以实现最终的不变性学习。

Result: 本文在四种流行的步态数据集（Gait3D、GREW、CCPG、SUSTech1K）上进行了广泛的实验，结果显示在各种步态条件下都获得了优越的识别性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法能够在多种步态条件下实现卓越的步态识别性能，未来可以在更多的数据集上进行验证与应用，并进一步探索更多的几何变换来完善算法。

Abstract: The goal of gait recognition is to extract identity-invariant features of an individual under various gait conditions, e.g., cross-view and cross-clothing. Most gait models strive to implicitly learn the common traits across different gait conditions in a data-driven manner to pull different gait conditions closer for recognition. However, relatively few studies have explicitly explored the inherent relations between different gait conditions. For this purpose, we attempt to establish connections among different gait conditions and propose a new perspective to achieve gait recognition: variations in different gait conditions can be approximately viewed as a combination of geometric transformations. In this case, all we need is to determine the types of geometric transformations and achieve geometric invariance, then identity invariance naturally follows. As an initial attempt, we explore three common geometric transformations (i.e., Reflect, Rotate, and Scale) and design a $\mathcal{R}$eflect-$\mathcal{R}$otate-$\mathcal{S}$cale invariance learning framework, named ${\mathcal{RRS}}$-Gait. Specifically, it first flexibly adjusts the convolution kernel based on the specific geometric transformations to achieve approximate feature equivariance. Then these three equivariant-aware features are respectively fed into a global pooling operation for final invariance-aware learning. Extensive experiments on four popular gait datasets (Gait3D, GREW, CCPG, SUSTech1K) show superior performance across various gait conditions.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained on largescale datasets perform well in common scenarios but struggle with rare, long-tail situations due to limited scenario diversity. Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage broad knowledge from pre-trained visionlanguage models to address this limitation, yet face critical challenges: (1) numerical imprecision in trajectory prediction due to discrete tokenization, (2) heavy reliance on language annotations that introduce linguistic bias and annotation burden, and (3) computational inefficiency from multi-step chain-of-thought reasoning hinders real-time deployment. We propose LatentVLA, a novel framework that employs self-supervised latent action prediction to train VLA models without language annotations, eliminating linguistic bias while learning rich driving representations from unlabeled trajectory data. Through knowledge distillation, LatentVLA transfers the generalization capabilities of VLA models to efficient vision-based networks, achieving both robust performance and real-time efficiency. LatentVLA establishes a new state-of-the-art on the NAVSIM benchmark with a PDMS score of 92.4 and demonstrates strong zeroshot generalization on the nuScenes benchmark.

Abstract: Deep learning models for image compression often face practical limitations in hardware-constrained applications. Although these models achieve high-quality reconstructions, they are typically complex, heavyweight, and require substantial training data and computational resources. We propose a methodology to partially compress these networks by reducing the size of their encoders. Our approach uses a simplified knowledge distillation strategy to approximate the latent space of the original models with less data and shorter training, yielding lightweight encoders from heavyweight ones. We evaluate the resulting lightweight encoders across two different architectures on the image compression task. Experiments show that our method preserves reconstruction quality and statistical fidelity better than training lightweight encoders with the original loss, making it practical for resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Recent end-to-end autonomous driving approaches have leveraged Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance planning capabilities in complex driving scenarios. However, VLMs are inherently trained as generalist models, lacking specialized understanding of driving-specific reasoning in 3D space and time. When applied to autonomous driving, these models struggle to establish structured spatial-temporal representations that capture geometric relationships, scene context, and motion patterns critical for safe trajectory planning. To address these limitations, we propose SGDrive, a novel framework that explicitly structures the VLM's representation learning around driving-specific knowledge hierarchies. Built upon a pre-trained VLM backbone, SGDrive decomposes driving understanding into a scene-agent-goal hierarchy that mirrors human driving cognition: drivers first perceive the overall environment (scene context), then attend to safety-critical agents and their behaviors, and finally formulate short-term goals before executing actions. This hierarchical decomposition provides the structured spatial-temporal representation that generalist VLMs lack, integrating multi-level information into a compact yet comprehensive format for trajectory planning. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that SGDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance among camera-only methods on both PDMS and EPDMS, validating the effectiveness of hierarchical knowledge structuring for adapting generalist VLMs to autonomous driving.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Charts are high-density visual carriers of complex data and medium for information extraction and analysis. Due to the need for precise and complex visual reasoning, automated chart understanding poses a significant challenge to existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Many MLLMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) face the challenge of credit assignment. Their advantage estimation, typically performed at the trajectory level, cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning steps within a single generated response. To address this limitation, we introduce SketchVL, a novel MLLM that optimized with FinePO, a new RL algorithm designed for fine-grained credit assignment within each trajectory. SketchVL's methodology involves drawing its intermediate reasoning steps as markers on the image and feeding the annotated image back to itself, creating a robust, multi-step reasoning process. During training, the FinePO algorithm leverages a Fine-grained Process Reward Model (FinePRM) to score each drawing action within a trajectory, thereby precisely assigning credit for each step. This mechanism allows FinePO to more strongly reward correct tokens when a trajectory is globally successful, and more heavily penalize incorrect tokens when the trajectory is globally suboptimal, thus achieving fine-grained reinforcement signals. Experiments show that SketchVL learns to align its step-level behavior with the FinePRM, achieving an average performance gain of 7.23\% over its base model across chart datasets, natural image datasets, and mathematics, providing a promising new direction for training powerful reasoning models.

Abstract: Generating high-quality 3D characters from single images remains a significant challenge in digital content creation, particularly due to complex body poses and self-occlusion. In this paper, we present RCM (Rotate your Character Model), an advanced image-to-video diffusion framework tailored for high-quality novel view synthesis (NVS) and 3D character generation. Compared to existing diffusion-based approaches, RCM offers several key advantages: (1) transferring characters with any complex poses into a canonical pose, enabling consistent novel view synthesis across the entire viewing orbit, (2) high-resolution orbital video generation at 1024x1024 resolution, (3) controllable observation positions given different initial camera poses, and (4) multi-view conditioning supporting up to 4 input images, accommodating diverse user scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RCM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view synthesis and 3D generation quality.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of integrating Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into flow matching models, particularly for text-to-image and text-to-video generation. However, we find that directly applying these techniques to image-to-video (I2V) models often fails to yield consistent reward improvements. To address this limitation, we present TAGRPO, a robust post-training framework for I2V models inspired by contrastive learning. Our approach is grounded in the observation that rollout videos generated from identical initial noise provide superior guidance for optimization. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel GRPO loss applied to intermediate latents, encouraging direct alignment with high-reward trajectories while maximizing distance from low-reward counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a memory bank for rollout videos to enhance diversity and reduce computational overhead. Despite its simplicity, TAGRPO achieves significant improvements over DanceGRPO in I2V generation.

Abstract: We present a real-time tracking SLAM system that unifies efficient camera tracking with photorealistic feature-enriched mapping using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our main contribution is integrating dense feature rasterization into the novel-view synthesis, aligned with a visual foundation model. This yields strong semantics, going beyond basic RGB-D input, aiding both tracking and mapping accuracy. Unlike previous semantic SLAM approaches (which embed pre-defined class labels) FeatureSLAM enables entirely new downstream tasks via free-viewpoint, open-set segmentation. Across standard benchmarks, our method achieves real-time tracking, on par with state-of-the-art systems while improving tracking stability and map fidelity without prohibitive compute. Quantitatively, we obtain 9\% lower pose error and 8\% higher mapping accuracy compared to recent fixed-set SLAM baselines. Our results confirm that real-time feature-embedded SLAM, is not only valuable for enabling new downstream applications. It also improves the performance of the underlying tracking and mapping subsystems, providing semantic and language masking results that are on-par with offline 3DGS models, alongside state-of-the-art tracking, depth and RGB rendering.

Current approaches primarily exploit only final-layer representations, while training-free methods require multiple forward passes or backpropagation. We propose ViTNT-FIQA, a training-free approach that measures the stability of patch embedding evolution across intermediate Vision Transformer (ViT) blocks. We demonstrate that high-quality face images exhibit stable feature refinement trajectories across blocks, while degraded images show erratic transformations. Our method computes Euclidean distances between L2-normalized patch embeddings from consecutive transformer blocks and aggregates them into image-level quality scores. We empirically validate this correlation on a quality-labeled synthetic dataset with controlled degradation levels. Unlike existing training-free approaches, ViTNT-FIQA requires only a single forward pass without backpropagation or architectural modifications. Through extensive evaluation on eight benchmarks (LFW, AgeDB-30, CFP-FP, CALFW, Adience, CPLFW, XQLFW, IJB-C), we show that ViTNT-FIQA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency and immediate applicability to any pre-trained ViT-based face recognition model.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in close proximity to humans for applications such as parcel delivery, traffic monitoring, disaster response and infrastructure inspections. Ensuring safe and reliable operation in these human-populated environments demands accurate perception of human poses and actions from an aerial viewpoint. This perspective challenges existing methods with low resolution, steep viewing angles and (self-)occlusion, especially if the application demands realtime feasibile models. We train and deploy FlyPose, a lightweight top-down human pose estimation pipeline for aerial imagery. Through multi-dataset training, we achieve an average improvement of 6.8 mAP in person detection across the test-sets of Manipal-UAV, VisDrone, HIT-UAV as well as our custom dataset. For 2D human pose estimation we report an improvement of 16.3 mAP on the challenging UAV-Human dataset. FlyPose runs with an inference latency of ~20 milliseconds including preprocessing on a Jetson Orin AGX Developer Kit and is deployed onboard a quadrotor UAV during flight experiments. We also publish FlyPose-104, a small but challenging aerial human pose estimation dataset, that includes manual annotations from difficult aerial perspectives: https://github.com/farooqhassaan/FlyPose.

Abstract: Multi-view multi-label learning frequently suffers from simultaneous feature absence and incomplete annotations, due to challenges in data acquisition and cost-intensive supervision. To tackle the complex yet highly practical problem while overcoming the existing limitations of feature recovery, representation disentanglement, and label semantics modeling, we propose an Adaptive Disentangled Representation Learning method (ADRL). ADRL achieves robust view completion by propagating feature-level affinity across modalities with neighborhood awareness, and reinforces reconstruction effectiveness by leveraging a stochastic masking strategy. Through disseminating category-level association across label distributions, ADRL refines distribution parameters for capturing interdependent label prototypes. Besides, we formulate a mutual-information-based objective to promote consistency among shared representations and suppress information overlap between view-specific representation and other modalities. Theoretically, we derive the tractable bounds to train the dual-channel network. Moreover, ADRL performs prototype-specific feature selection by enabling independent interactions between label embeddings and view representations, accompanied by the generation of pseudo-labels for each category. The structural characteristics of the pseudo-label space are then exploited to guide a discriminative trade-off during view fusion. Finally, extensive experiments on public datasets and real-world applications demonstrate the superior performance of ADRL.

Abstract: The ability to automatically generate large-scale, interactive, and physically realistic 3D environments is crucial for advancing robotic learning and embodied intelligence. However, existing generative approaches often fail to capture the functional complexity of real-world interiors, particularly those containing articulated objects with movable parts essential for manipulation and navigation. This paper presents SceneFoundry, a language-guided diffusion framework that generates apartment-scale 3D worlds with functionally articulated furniture and semantically diverse layouts for robotic training. From natural language prompts, an LLM module controls floor layout generation, while diffusion-based posterior sampling efficiently populates the scene with articulated assets from large-scale 3D repositories. To ensure physical usability, SceneFoundry employs differentiable guidance functions to regulate object quantity, prevent articulation collisions, and maintain sufficient walkable space for robotic navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates structurally valid, semantically coherent, and functionally interactive environments across diverse scene types and conditions, enabling scalable embodied AI research.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) generate high-quality images by operating in a compressed latent space, typically obtained through image tokenizers such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In pursuit of a generation-friendly VAE, recent studies have explored leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as representation alignment targets for VAEs, mirroring the approach commonly adopted for LDMs. Although this yields certain performance gains, using the same alignment target for both VAEs and LDMs overlooks their fundamentally different representational requirements. We advocate that while LDMs benefit from latents retaining high-level semantic concepts, VAEs should excel in semantic disentanglement, enabling encoding of attribute-level information in a structured way. To address this, we propose the Semantic disentangled VAE (Send-VAE), explicitly optimized for disentangled representation learning through aligning its latent space with the semantic hierarchy of pre-trained VFMs. Our approach employs a non-linear mapper network to transform VAE latents, aligning them with VFMs to bridge the gap between attribute-level disentanglement and high-level semantics, facilitating effective guidance for VAE learning. We evaluate semantic disentanglement via linear probing on attribute prediction tasks, showing strong correlation with improved generation performance. Finally, using Send-VAE, we train flow-based transformers SiTs; experiments show Send-VAE significantly speeds up training and achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.21 and 1.75 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256x256.

Abstract: Accurate surround-view depth estimation provides a competitive alternative to laser-based sensors and is essential for 3D scene understanding in autonomous driving. While prior studies have proposed various approaches that primarily focus on enforcing cross-view constraints at the photometric level, few explicitly exploit the rich geometric structure inherent in both monocular and surround-view setting. In this work, we propose GeoSurDepth, a framework that leverages geometry consistency as the primary cue for surround-view depth estimation. Concretely, we utilize foundation models as a pseudo geometry prior and feature representation enhancement tool to guide the network to maintain surface normal consistency in spatial 3D space and regularize object- and texture-consistent depth estimation in 2D. In addition, we introduce a novel view synthesis pipeline where 2D-3D lifting is achieved with dense depth reconstructed via spatial warping, encouraging additional photometric supervision across temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal contexts, and compensating for the limitations of single-view image reconstruction. Finally, a newly-proposed adaptive joint motion learning strategy enables the network to adaptively emphasize informative spatial geometry cues for improved motion reasoning. Extensive experiments on DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate that GeoSurDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our framework highlights the importance of exploiting geometry coherence and consistency for robust self-supervised multi-view depth estimation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the development of ``world models'' capable of simulating potential futures for robotics and planning. However, specifying precise goals for these models remains a challenge; text instructions are often too abstract to capture physical nuances, while target images are frequently infeasible to specify for dynamic tasks. To address this, we introduce Goal Force, a novel framework that allows users to define goals via explicit force vectors and intermediate dynamics, mirroring how humans conceptualize physical tasks. We train a video generation model on a curated dataset of synthetic causal primitives-such as elastic collisions and falling dominos-teaching it to propagate forces through time and space. Despite being trained on simple physics data, our model exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to complex, real-world scenarios, including tool manipulation and multi-object causal chains. Our results suggest that by grounding video generation in fundamental physical interactions, models can emerge as implicit neural physics simulators, enabling precise, physics-aware planning without reliance on external engines. We release all datasets, code, model weights, and interactive video demos at our project page.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel latent diffusion-based pipeline for 3D kidney anomaly detection on contrast-enhanced abdominal CT. The method combines Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIMs), and Vector-Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQ-GANs). Unlike prior slice-wise approaches, our method operates directly on an image volume and leverages weak supervision with only case-level pseudo-labels. We benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art supervised segmentation and detection models. This study demonstrates the feasibility and promise of 3D latent diffusion for weakly supervised anomaly detection. While the current results do not yet match supervised baselines, they reveal key directions for improving reconstruction fidelity and lesion localization. Our findings provide an important step toward annotation-efficient, generative modeling of complex abdominal anatomy.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for decomposing arbitrarily posed humans into animatable multi-layered 3D human avatars, separating the body and garments. Conventional single-layer reconstruction methods lock clothing to one identity, while prior multi-layer approaches struggle with occluded regions. We overcome both limitations by encoding each layer as a set of 2D Gaussians for accurate geometry and photorealistic rendering, and inpainting hidden regions with a pretrained 2D diffusion model via score-distillation sampling (SDS). Our three-stage training strategy first reconstructs the coarse canonical garment via single-layer reconstruction, followed by multi-layer training to jointly recover the inner-layer body and outer-layer garment details. Experiments on two 3D human benchmark datasets (4D-Dress, Thuman2.0) show that our approach achieves better rendering quality and layer decomposition and recomposition than the previous state-of-the-art, enabling realistic virtual try-on under novel viewpoints and poses, and advancing practical creation of high-fidelity 3D human assets for immersive applications.

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is an effective method for addressing scenarios with limited labeled data. Existing methods mainly rely on frameworks such as mean teacher and dual-stream consistency learning. These approaches often face issues like error accumulation and model structural complexity, while also neglecting the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data streams. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Bidirectional Channel-selective Semantic Interaction~(BCSI) framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. First, we propose a Semantic-Spatial Perturbation~(SSP) mechanism, which disturbs the data using two strong augmentation operations and leverages unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels from weak augmentations. Additionally, we employ consistency on the predictions from the two strong augmentations to further improve model stability and robustness. Second, to reduce noise during the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a Channel-selective Router~(CR) component, which dynamically selects the most relevant channels for information exchange. This mechanism ensures that only highly relevant features are activated, minimizing unnecessary interference. Finally, the Bidirectional Channel-wise Interaction~(BCI) strategy is employed to supplement additional semantic information and enhance the representation of important channels. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking 3D medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches.

Abstract: Recent deepfake detection methods have increasingly explored frequency domain representations to reveal manipulation artifacts that are difficult to detect in the spatial domain. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on spectral magnitude, implicitly under exploring the role of phase information. In this work, we propose Phase4DFD, a phase aware frequency domain deepfake detection framework that explicitly models phase magnitude interactions via a learnable attention mechanism. Our approach augments standard RGB input with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) magnitude and local binary pattern (LBP) representations to expose subtle synthesis artifacts that remain indistinguishable under spatial analysis alone. Crucially, we introduce an input level phase aware attention module that uses phase discontinuities commonly introduced by synthetic generation to guide the model toward frequency patterns that are most indicative of manipulation before backbone feature extraction. The attended multi domain representation is processed by an efficient BNext M backbone, with optional channel spatial attention applied for semantic feature refinement. Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE and DFFD datasets demonstrate that our proposed model Phase4DFD outperforms state of the art spatial and frequency-based detectors while maintaining low computational overhead. Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm that explicit phase modeling provides complementary and non-redundant information beyond magnitude-only frequency representations.

Abstract: Current approaches for segmenting ultra high resolution images either slide a window, thereby discarding global context, or downsample and lose fine detail. We propose a simple yet effective method that brings explicit multi scale reasoning to vision transformers, simultaneously preserving local details and global awareness. Concretely, we process each image in parallel at a local scale (high resolution, small crops) and a global scale (low resolution, large crops), and aggregate and propagate features between the two branches with a small set of learnable relay tokens. The design plugs directly into standard transformer backbones (eg ViT and Swin) and adds fewer than 2 % parameters. Extensive experiments on three ultra high resolution segmentation benchmarks, Archaeoscape, URUR, and Gleason, and on the conventional Cityscapes dataset show consistent gains, with up to 15 % relative mIoU improvement. Code and pretrained models are available at https://archaeoscape.ai/work/relay-tokens/ .

Abstract: Background: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive cancers, with poor survival rates. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a key diagnostic modality, but its effectiveness is constrained by operator subjectivity. This study evaluates a Vision Transformer-based deep learning segmentation model for pancreatic tumors. Methods: A segmentation model using the USFM framework with a Vision Transformer backbone was trained and validated with 17,367 EUS images (from two public datasets) in 5-fold cross-validation. The model was tested on an independent dataset of 350 EUS images from another public dataset, manually segmented by radiologists. Preprocessing included grayscale conversion, cropping, and resizing to 512x512 pixels. Metrics included Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), intersection over union (IoU), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results: In 5-fold cross-validation, the model achieved a mean DSC of 0.651 +/- 0.738, IoU of 0.579 +/- 0.658, sensitivity of 69.8%, specificity of 98.8%, and accuracy of 97.5%. For the external validation set, the model achieved a DSC of 0.657 (95% CI: 0.634-0.769), IoU of 0.614 (95% CI: 0.590-0.689), sensitivity of 71.8%, and specificity of 97.7%. Results were consistent, but 9.7% of cases exhibited erroneous multiple predictions. Conclusions: The Vision Transformer-based model demonstrated strong performance for pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS images. However, dataset heterogeneity and limited external validation highlight the need for further refinement, standardization, and prospective studies.

Abstract: Hallucinations, generating responses inconsistent with the visual input, remain a critical limitation of large vision-language models (LVLMs), especially in open-ended tasks such as image captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we probe the layer-wise generation dynamics that drive hallucinations and propose a training-free mitigation strategy. Employing the Logit Lens, we examine how LVLMs construct next-token distributions across decoder layers, uncovering a pronounced commitment-depth gap: truthful tokens accumulate probability mass on their final candidates earlier than hallucinatory ones. Drawing on this discovery, we introduce Context Embedding Injection (CEI), a lightweight method that harnesses the hidden state of the last input token-the context embedding-as a grounding signal to maintain visual fidelity throughout decoding and curb hallucinations. Evaluated on the CHAIR, AMBER, and MMHal-Bench benchmarks (with a maximum token length of 512), CEI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three LVLMs, with its dynamic variant yielding the lowest overall hallucination rates. By integrating novel mechanistic insights with a scalable intervention, this work advances the mitigation of hallucinations in LVLMs.

Abstract: Domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation is critical for automated ophthalmic diagnosis, yet faces significant challenges from domain shift induced by non-uniform illumination and varying contrast, compounded by the difficulty of preserving fine vessel structures. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits remarkable zero-shot capabilities, existing SAM-based methods rely on simple adapter fine-tuning while overlooking frequency-domain information that encodes domain-invariant features, resulting in degraded generalization under illumination and contrast variations. Furthermore, SAM's direct upsampling inevitably loses fine vessel details. To address these limitations, we propose WaveRNet, a wavelet-guided frequency learning framework for robust multi-source domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation. Specifically, we devise a Spectral-guided Domain Modulator (SDM) that integrates wavelet decomposition with learnable domain tokens, enabling the separation of illumination-robust low-frequency structures from high-frequency vessel boundaries while facilitating domain-specific feature generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Frequency-Adaptive Domain Fusion (FADF) module that performs intelligent test-time domain selection through wavelet-based frequency similarity and soft-weighted fusion. Finally, we present a Hierarchical Mask-Prompt Refiner (HMPR) that overcomes SAM's upsampling limitation through coarse-to-fine refinement with long-range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments under the Leave-One-Domain-Out protocol on four public retinal datasets demonstrate that WaveRNet achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have been dominated by diffusion and flow-matching models, which produce high-quality results but remain computationally intensive and difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce VideoAR, the first large-scale Visual Autoregressive (VAR) framework for video generation that combines multi-scale next-frame prediction with autoregressive modeling. VideoAR disentangles spatial and temporal dependencies by integrating intra-frame VAR modeling with causal next-frame prediction, supported by a 3D multi-scale tokenizer that efficiently encodes spatio-temporal dynamics. To improve long-term consistency, we propose Multi-scale Temporal RoPE, Cross-Frame Error Correction, and Random Frame Mask, which collectively mitigate error propagation and stabilize temporal coherence. Our multi-stage pretraining pipeline progressively aligns spatial and temporal learning across increasing resolutions and durations. Empirically, VideoAR achieves new state-of-the-art results among autoregressive models, improving FVD on UCF-101 from 99.5 to 88.6 while reducing inference steps by over 10x, and reaching a VBench score of 81.74-competitive with diffusion-based models an order of magnitude larger. These results demonstrate that VideoAR narrows the performance gap between autoregressive and diffusion paradigms, offering a scalable, efficient, and temporally consistent foundation for future video generation research.

Abstract: Deformable multi-contrast image registration is a challenging yet crucial task due to the complex, non-linear intensity relationships across different imaging contrasts. Conventional registration methods typically rely on iterative optimization of the deformation field, which is time-consuming. Although recent learning-based approaches enable fast and accurate registration during inference, their generalizability remains limited to the specific contrasts observed during training. In this work, we propose an adaptive conditional contrast-agnostic deformable image registration framework (AC-CAR) based on a random convolution-based contrast augmentation scheme. AC-CAR can generalize to arbitrary imaging contrasts without observing them during training. To encourage contrast-invariant feature learning, we propose an adaptive conditional feature modulator (ACFM) that adaptively modulates the features and the contrast-invariant latent regularization to enforce the consistency of the learned feature across different imaging contrasts. Additionally, we enable our framework to provide contrast-agnostic registration uncertainty by integrating a variance network that leverages the contrast-agnostic registration encoder to improve the trustworthiness and reliability of AC-CAR. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-CAR outperforms baseline methods in registration accuracy and exhibits superior generalization to unseen imaging contrasts. Code is available at https://github.com/Yinsong0510/AC-CAR.

Abstract: Public debates about "left-" or "right-wing" news overlook the fact that bias is usually conveyed by concrete linguistic manoeuvres that transcend any single political spectrum. We therefore shift the focus from where an outlet allegedly stands to how partiality is expressed in individual sentences. Drawing on 26,464 sentences collected from newsroom corpora, user submissions and our own browsing, we iteratively combine close-reading, interdisciplinary theory and pilot annotation to derive a fine-grained, sentence-level taxonomy of media bias and propaganda. The result is a two-tier schema comprising 38 elementary bias types, arranged in six functional families and visualised as a "table of media-bias elements". For each type we supply a definition, real-world examples, cognitive and societal drivers, and guidance for recognition. A quantitative survey of a random 155-sentence sample illustrates prevalence differences, while a cross-walk to the best-known NLP and communication-science taxonomies reveals substantial coverage gains and reduced ambiguity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents that invoke external tools through structured function calls. While recent work reports strong tool-calling performance under standard English-centric evaluations, the robustness of tool calling under multilingual user interactions remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce MLCL, a diagnostic benchmark, and conduct a systematic evaluation of multilingual tool calling across Chinese, Hindi, and the low-resource language Igbo. Through fine-grained error analysis, we show that many failures occur despite correct intent understanding and tool selection. We identify parameter value language mismatch as a dominant failure mode, where models generate semantically appropriate parameter values in the user's language, violating language-invariant execution conventions. We further evaluate several inference-time system strategies and find that while these strategies substantially reduce language-induced execution errors, none of them can fully recover English-level performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied across various domains of finance. Since their training data are largely derived from human-authored corpora, LLMs may inherit a range of human biases. Behavioral biases can lead to instability and uncertainty in decision-making, particularly when processing financial information. However, existing research on LLM bias has mainly focused on direct questioning or simplified, general-purpose settings, with limited consideration of the complex real-world financial environments and high-risk, context-sensitive, multilingual financial misinformation detection tasks (\mfmd). In this work, we propose \mfmdscen, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating behavioral biases of LLMs in \mfmd across diverse economic scenarios. In collaboration with financial experts, we construct three types of complex financial scenarios: (i) role- and personality-based, (ii) role- and region-based, and (iii) role-based scenarios incorporating ethnicity and religious beliefs. We further develop a multilingual financial misinformation dataset covering English, Chinese, Greek, and Bengali. By integrating these scenarios with misinformation claims, \mfmdscen enables a systematic evaluation of 22 mainstream LLMs. Our findings reveal that pronounced behavioral biases persist across both commercial and open-source models.

### [58] [Large Language Models Are Bad Dice Players: LLMs Struggle to Generate Random Numbers from Statistical Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05414)
*Minda Zhao,Yilun Du,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次进行了大规模统计审计，评估了领先语言模型在15种分布上的原生概率采样能力。研究发现，批处理生成方案的统计有效性有限，而独立请求几乎无法达到任何形式的有效性。采样精度随分布复杂度和所请求的采样范围增加而恶化。这些发现表明现有LLMs缺乏功能性的内部采样器，并建议在需要统计保证的应用中使用外部工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs的应用领域不断扩展，其在随机管道中的作用更加重要，因此原生概率采样的能力变得至关重要。本文旨在填补该领域的空白，提供一个广泛的评估以揭示当前语言模型在概率采样方面的弱点。

Method: 本文采用了一种双重协议设计进行评估：批处理生成和独立请求。两种方案分别测试了语言模型在生成大量样本和单次独立请求中的表现。

Result: 评估结果显示，批处理生成在多个分布上的通过率较低，而独立请求几乎得不到任何通过。同时，采样精度随分布复杂性和采样范围增加而下降。

Conclusion: 研究发现当前的LLMs在概率采样方面存在明显缺陷，无法满足许多应用场景的统计保证需求，建议在必要时使用外部工具以弥补此缺陷。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) transition from chat interfaces to integral components of stochastic pipelines across domains like educational assessment and synthetic data construction, the ability to faithfully sample from specified probability distributions has become a functional requirement rather than a theoretical curiosity. We present the first large-scale, statistically powered audit of native probabilistic sampling in frontier LLMs, benchmarking 11 models across 15 distributions. To disentangle failure modes, we employ a dual-protocol design: Batch Generation, where a model produces N=1000 samples within one response, and Independent Requests, comprising $N=1000$ stateless calls. We observe a sharp protocol asymmetry: batch generation achieves only modest statistical validity, with a 13% median pass rate, while independent requests collapse almost entirely, with 10 of 11 models passing none of the distributions. Beyond this asymmetry, we reveal that sampling fidelity degrades monotonically with distributional complexity and aggravates as the requested sampling horizon N increases. Finally, we demonstrate the propagation of these failures into downstream tasks: models fail to enforce uniform answer-position constraints in MCQ generation and systematically violate demographic targets in attribute-constrained text-to-image prompt synthesis. These findings indicate that current LLMs lack a functional internal sampler, necessitating the use of external tools for applications requiring statistical guarantees.

TL;DR: 研究结合层次分析和稀疏自编码器特征，展示了LLMs在特定层次上区分和表达道德基础的方式，表明这些模型中的道德概念是分布的、层级化的，并且部分解耦，从语言统计规律中可形成多元的道德结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型（LLMs）在道德判断上表现出类似人类的行为，但尚不清楚是基于内部概念结构还是表面模仿，因此需要通过研究来揭示其背后的具体机制。

Method: 研究采用了层次分析、预训练稀疏自编码器及因果控制方法，综合分析过程在两个指令调优LLMs（Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct）上进行。

Result: 研究结果表明，模型在特定层次上能够区分和表达道德基础，并且显示出部分解耦的机制。通过操纵经历稀疏自编码器的密集向量或稀疏特征，模型在与道德特定基础相关的行为上产生了可预测的变化，证明了内部表示与道德输出之间的因果关系。

Conclusion: 这些发现证明LLMs中的道德概念是分布、层级化且部分解耦的，表明多元道德结构可以在语言统计规律的潜在模式中自然涌现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce human-like moral judgments, but it is unclear whether this reflects an internal conceptual structure or superficial ``moral mimicry.'' Using Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) as an analytic framework, we study how moral foundations are encoded, organized, and expressed within two instruction-tuned LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. We employ a multi-level approach combining (i) layer-wise analysis of MFT concept representations and their alignment with human moral perceptions, (ii) pretrained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) over the residual stream to identify sparse features that support moral concepts, and (iii) causal steering interventions using dense MFT vectors and sparse SAE features. We find that both models represent and distinguish moral foundations in a structured, layer-dependent way that aligns with human judgments. At a finer scale, SAE features show clear semantic links to specific foundations, suggesting partially disentangled mechanisms within shared representations. Finally, steering along either dense vectors or sparse features produces predictable shifts in foundation-relevant behavior, demonstrating a causal connection between internal representations and moral outputs. Together, our results provide mechanistic evidence that moral concepts in LLMs are distributed, layered, and partly disentangled, suggesting that pluralistic moral structure can emerge as a latent pattern from the statistical regularities of language alone.

Conclusion: 研究得出结论，多语言推理能力提升的关键在于有效激发和对齐已有的推理能力，而非注入新的语言知识。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning and self-correction abilities in high-resource languages like English, but their performance remains limited in low-resource languages such as Korean. In this study, we investigate whether reinforcement learning (RL) can enhance Korean reasoning abilities to a degree comparable to English. Our findings reveal that RL alone yields limited improvements when applied to models lacking inherent Korean reasoning capabilities. To address this, we explore several fine-tuning strategies and show that aligning the model's internal reasoning processes with Korean inputs-particularly by tuning Korean-specific neurons in early layers-is key to unlocking RL's effectiveness. We introduce a self-correction code-switching dataset to facilitate this alignment and observe significant performance gains in both mathematical reasoning and self-correction tasks. Ultimately, we conclude that the crucial factor in multilingual reasoning enhancement is not injecting new linguistic knowledge, but effectively eliciting and aligning existing reasoning capabilities. Our study provides a new perspective on how internal translation and neuron-level tuning contribute to multilingual reasoning alignment in LLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents a conceptual and methodological framework for large language model (LLM) based student simulation in educational settings. The authors identify a core failure mode, termed the "competence paradox" in which broadly capable LLMs are asked to emulate partially knowledgeable learners, leading to unrealistic error patterns and learning dynamics. To address this, the paper reframes student simulation as a constrained generation problem governed by an explicit Epistemic State Specification (ESS), which defines what a simulated learner can access, how errors are structured, and how learner state evolves over time. The work further introduces a Goal-by-Environment framework to situate simulated student systems according to behavioral objectives and deployment contexts. Rather than proposing a new system or benchmark, the paper synthesizes prior literature, formalizes key design dimensions, and articulates open challenges related to validity, evaluation, and ethical risks. Overall, the paper argues for epistemic fidelity over surface realism as a prerequisite for using LLM-based simulated students as reliable scientific and pedagogical instruments.

Abstract: To reliably assist human decision-making, LLMs must maintain factual internal beliefs against misleading injections. While current models resist explicit misinformation, we uncover a fundamental vulnerability to sophisticated, hard-to-falsify evidence. To systematically probe this weakness, we introduce MisBelief, a framework that generates misleading evidence via collaborative, multi-round interactions among multi-role LLMs. This process mimics subtle, defeasible reasoning and progressive refinement to create logically persuasive yet factually deceptive claims. Using MisBelief, we generate 4,800 instances across three difficulty levels to evaluate 7 representative LLMs. Results indicate that while models are robust to direct misinformation, they are highly sensitive to this refined evidence: belief scores in falsehoods increase by an average of 93.0\%, fundamentally compromising downstream recommendations. To address this, we propose Deceptive Intent Shielding (DIS), a governance mechanism that provides an early warning signal by inferring the deceptive intent behind evidence. Empirical results demonstrate that DIS consistently mitigates belief shifts and promotes more cautious evidence evaluation.

Abstract: Maintaining consistency in long-term dialogues remains a fundamental challenge for LLMs, as standard retrieval mechanisms often fail to capture the temporal evolution of historical states. While memory-augmented frameworks offer a structured alternative, current systems rely on static prompting of closed-source models or suffer from ineffective training paradigms with sparse rewards. We introduce MemBuilder, a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to orchestrate multi-dimensional memory construction with attributed dense rewards. MemBuilder addresses two key challenges: (1) Sparse Trajectory-Level Rewards: we employ synthetic session-level question generation to provide dense intermediate rewards across extended trajectories; and (2) Multi-Dimensional Memory Attribution: we introduce contribution-aware gradient weighting that scales policy updates based on each component's downstream impact. Experimental results show that MemBuilder enables a 4B-parameter model to outperform state-of-the-art closed-source baselines, exhibiting strong generalization across long-term dialogue benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The stateless architecture of Large Language Models inherently lacks the mechanism to preserve dynamic context, compelling agents to redundantly reprocess history to maintain long-horizon autonomy. While latent memory offers a solution, current approaches are hindered by architectural segregation, relying on auxiliary encoders that decouple memory from the reasoning backbone. We propose FlashMem, a framework that distills intrinsic memory directly from transient reasoning states via computation reuse. Leveraging the property that internal representations uniquely encode input trajectories, FlashMem identifies the last hidden state as a sufficient statistic for the interaction history. This enables a Shared-KV Consolidator to synthesize memory by attending directly to the backbone's frozen cache, eliminating redundant re-parameterization. Furthermore, a parameter-free Cognitive Monitor leverages attention entropy to adaptively trigger consolidation only when high epistemic uncertainty is detected. Experiments demonstrate that FlashMem matches the performance of heavy baselines while reducing inference latency by 5 times, effectively bridging the gap between efficiency and persistent cognition.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Despite strong performance on many tasks, large language models (LLMs) show limited ability in historical and cultural reasoning, particularly in non-English contexts such as Chinese history. Taxonomic structures offer an effective mechanism to organize historical knowledge and improve understanding. However, manual taxonomy construction is costly and difficult to scale. Therefore, we propose \textbf{CHisAgent}, a multi-agent LLM framework for historical taxonomy construction in ancient Chinese contexts. CHisAgent decomposes taxonomy construction into three role-specialized stages: a bottom-up \textit{Inducer} that derives an initial hierarchy from raw historical corpora, a top-down \textit{Expander} that introduces missing intermediate concepts using LLM world knowledge, and an evidence-guided \textit{Enricher} that integrates external structured historical resources to ensure faithfulness. Using the \textit{Twenty-Four Histories}, we construct a large-scale, domain-aware event taxonomy covering politics, military, diplomacy, and social life in ancient China. Extensive reference-free and reference-based evaluations demonstrate improved structural coherence and coverage, while further analysis shows that the resulting taxonomy supports cross-cultural alignment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Parallel Speculative Decoding (PSD) accelerates traditional Speculative Decoding (SD) by overlapping draft generation with verification. However, it remains hampered by two fundamental challenges: (1) a theoretical speedup ceiling dictated by the speed ratio between the draft and target models, and (2) high computational waste and pipeline stall due to mid-sequence token rejections of early errors. To address these limitations, we introduce \textsc{Double} (Double Retrieval Speculative Parallelism). By bridging the gap between SD and PSD, our framework resolves the Retrieval \emph{Precision-Efficiency Dilemma} through a novel synchronous mechanism. Specifically, we enable the draft model to execute iterative retrieval speculations to break the theoretical speedup limits; to alleviate rejections without rollback, the target model performs authoritative retrieval to generate multi-token guidance. \textsc{Double} is entirely training-free and lossless. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art speedup of $\textbf{5.3}\times$ on LLaMA3.3-70B and $\textbf{2.8}\times$ on Qwen3-32B, significantly outperforming the advanced method EAGLE-3 that requires extensive model training.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Although speech large language models have achieved notable progress, a substantial modality reasoning gap remains: their reasoning performance on speech inputs is markedly weaker than on text. This gap could be associated with representational drift across Transformer layers and behavior deviations in long-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce TARS, a reinforcement-learning framework that aligns text-conditioned and speech-conditioned trajectories through an asymmetric reward design. The framework employs two dense and complementary signals: representation alignment, which measures layer-wise hidden-state similarity between speech- and text-conditioned trajectories, and behavior alignment, which evaluates semantic consistency between generated outputs and reference text completions. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including MMSU and OBQA, show that our approach significantly narrows the modality reasoning gap and achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale Speech LLMs.

Abstract: This study addresses critical gaps in Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems and Large Language Models (LLMs) with regard to their ability to effectively identify and score harmful essays. Despite advancements in AES technology, current models often overlook ethically and morally problematic elements within essays, erroneously assigning high scores to essays that may propagate harmful opinions. In this study, we introduce the Harmful Essay Detection (HED) benchmark, which includes essays integrating sensitive topics such as racism and gender bias, to test the efficacy of various LLMs in recognizing and scoring harmful content. Our findings reveal that: (1) LLMs require further enhancement to accurately distinguish between harmful and argumentative essays, and (2) both current AES models and LLMs fail to consider the ethical dimensions of content during scoring. The study underscores the need for developing more robust AES systems that are sensitive to the ethical implications of the content they are scoring.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Keep Emotional and Essential Memory (KEEM) dataset, a novel generation-based dataset designed to enhance memory updates in long-term conversational systems. Unlike existing approaches that rely on simple accumulation or operation-based methods, which often result in information conflicts and difficulties in accurately tracking a user's current state, KEEM dynamically generates integrative memories. This process not only preserves essential factual information but also incorporates emotional context and causal relationships, enabling a more nuanced understanding of user interactions. By seamlessly updating a system's memory with both emotional and essential data, our approach promotes deeper empathy and enhances the system's ability to respond meaningfully in open-domain conversations.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with long chain-of-thought reasoning have recently achieved remarkable success. Yet, equipping domain-specialized models with such reasoning capabilities, referred to as "Reasoning + X", remains a significant challenge. While model merging offers a promising training-free solution, existing methods often suffer from a destructive performance collapse: existing methods tend to both weaken reasoning depth and compromise domain-specific utility. Interestingly, we identify a counter-intuitive phenomenon underlying this failure: reasoning ability predominantly resides in parameter regions with low gradient sensitivity, contrary to the common assumption that domain capabilities correspond to high-magnitude parameters. Motivated by this insight, we propose ReasonAny, a novel merging framework that resolves the reasoning-domain performance collapse through Contrastive Gradient Identification. Experiments across safety, biomedicine, and finance domains show that ReasonAny effectively synthesizes "Reasoning + X" capabilities, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while retaining robust reasoning performance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Social activities result from complex joint activity-travel decisions between group members. While observing the decision-making process of these activities is difficult via traditional travel surveys, the advent of new types of data, such as unstructured chat data, can help shed some light on these complex processes. However, interpreting these decision-making processes requires inferring both explicit and implicit factors. This typically involves the labor-intensive task of manually annotating dialogues to capture context-dependent meanings shaped by the social and cultural norms. This study evaluates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and complement human annotation in interpreting decision-making processes from group chats, using data on joint eating-out activities in Japan as a case study. We designed a prompting framework inspired by the knowledge acquisition process, which sequentially extracts key decision-making factors, including the group-level restaurant choice set and outcome, individual preferences of each alternative, and the specific attributes driving those preferences. This structured process guides the LLM to interpret group chat data, converting unstructured dialogues into structured tabular data describing decision-making factors. To evaluate LLM-driven outputs, we conduct a quantitative analysis using a human-annotated ground truth dataset and a qualitative error analysis to examine model limitations. Results show that while the LLM reliably captures explicit decision-making factors, it struggles to identify nuanced implicit factors that human annotators readily identified. We pinpoint specific contexts when LLM-based extraction can be trusted versus when human oversight remains essential. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLM-based analysis for incorporating non-traditional data sources on social activities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in multi-turn dialogue. However, in multi-turn dialogue, models still struggle to stay aligned with what has been established earlier, follow dependencies across many turns, and avoid drifting into incorrect facts as the interaction grows longer. Existing approaches primarily focus on extending the context window, introducing external memory, or applying context compression, yet these methods still face limitations such as \textbf{contextual inertia} and \textbf{state drift}. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}ontext \textbf{R}efactoring \textbf{(ACR)} Framework, which dynamically monitors and reshapes the interaction history to mitigate contextual inertia and state drift actively. ACR is built on a library of context refactoring operators and a teacher-guided self-evolving training paradigm that learns when to intervene and how to refactor, thereby decoupling context management from the reasoning process. Extensive experiments on multi-turn dialogue demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines while reducing token consumption.

Abstract: Toxic language is one of the major barrier to safe online participation, yet robust mitigation tools are scarce for African languages. This study addresses this critical gap by investigating automatic text detoxification (toxic to neutral rewriting) for two low-resource African languages, isiXhosa and Yorùbá. The work contributes a novel, pragmatic hybrid methodology: a lightweight, interpretable TF-IDF and Logistic Regression model for transparent toxicity detection, and a controlled lexicon- and token-guided rewriting component. A parallel corpus of toxic to neutral rewrites, which captures idiomatic usage, diacritics, and code switching, was developed to train and evaluate the model. The detection component achieved stratified K-fold accuracies of 61-72% (isiXhosa) and 72-86% (Yorùbá), with per-language ROC-AUCs up to 0.88. The rewriting component successfully detoxified all detected toxic sentences while preserving 100% of non-toxic sentences. These results demonstrate that scalable, interpretable machine learning detectors combined with rule-based edits offer a competitive and resource-efficient solution for culturally adaptive safety tooling, setting a new benchmark for low-resource Text Style Transfer (TST) in African languages.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in formal learning tasks such as mathematics and code generation, they still struggle with the "practical wisdom" and generalizable intelligence, such as strategic creativity and social reasoning, that characterize human cognition. This gap arises from a lack of informal learning, which thrives on interactive feedback rather than goal-oriented instruction. In this paper, we propose treating Games as a primary environment for LLM informal learning, leveraging their intrinsic reward signals and abstracted complexity to cultivate diverse competencies. To address the performance degradation observed in multi-task learning, we introduce a Nested Training Framework. Unlike naive task mixing optimizing an implicit "OR" objective, our framework employs sequential task composition to enforce an explicit "AND" objective, compelling the model to master multiple abilities simultaneously to achieve maximal rewards. Using GRPO-based reinforcement learning across Matrix Games, TicTacToe, and Who's the Spy games, we demonstrate that integrating game-based informal learning not only prevents task interference but also significantly bolsters the model's generalization across broad ability-oriented benchmarks. The framework and implementation are publicly available.

Abstract: As multilingual large language models become more widely used, ensuring their safety and fairness across diverse linguistic contexts presents unique challenges. While existing research on machine unlearning has primarily focused on monolingual settings, typically English, multilingual environments introduce additional complexities due to cross-lingual knowledge transfer and biases embedded in both pretraining and fine-tuning data. In this work, we study multilingual unlearning using the Aya-Expanse 8B model under two settings: (1) data unlearning and (2) concept unlearning. We extend benchmarks for factual knowledge and stereotypes to ten languages through translation: English, French, Arabic, Japanese, Russian, Farsi, Korean, Hindi, Hebrew, and Indonesian. These languages span five language families and a wide range of resource levels. Our experiments show that unlearning in high-resource languages is generally more stable, with asymmetric transfer effects observed between typologically related languages. Furthermore, our analysis of linguistic distances indicates that syntactic similarity is the strongest predictor of cross-lingual unlearning behavior.

Abstract: Estimating the persuasiveness of messages is critical in various applications, from recommender systems to safety assessment of LLMs. While it is imperative to consider the target persuadee's characteristics, such as their values, experiences, and reasoning styles, there is currently no established systematic framework to optimize leveraging a persuadee's past activities (e.g., conversations) to the benefit of a persuasiveness prediction model. To address this problem, we propose a context-aware user profiling framework with two trainable components: a query generator that generates optimal queries to retrieve persuasion-relevant records from a user's history, and a profiler that summarizes these records into a profile to effectively inform the persuasiveness prediction model. Our evaluation on the ChangeMyView Reddit dataset shows consistent improvements over existing methods across multiple predictor models, with gains of up to +13.77%p in F1 score. Further analysis shows that effective user profiles are context-dependent and predictor-specific, rather than relying on static attributes or surface-level similarity. Together, these results highlight the importance of task-oriented, context-dependent user profiling for personalized persuasiveness prediction.

Abstract: Instant-messaging human social chat typically progresses through a sequence of short messages. Existing step-by-step AI chatting systems typically split a one-shot generation into multiple messages and send them sequentially, but they lack an active waiting mechanism and exhibit unnatural message pacing. In order to address these issues, we propose Stephanie2, a novel next-generation step-wise decision-making dialogue agent. With active waiting and message-pace adaptation, Stephanie2 explicitly decides at each step whether to send or wait, and models latency as the sum of thinking time and typing time to achieve more natural pacing. We further introduce a time-window-based dual-agent dialogue system to generate pseudo dialogue histories for human and automatic evaluations. Experiments show that Stephanie2 clearly outperforms Stephanie1 on metrics such as naturalness and engagement, and achieves a higher pass rate on human evaluation with the role identification Turing test.

TL;DR: 该研究介绍了一项针对非洲语言的文化问答基准，名为Afri-MCQA，涵盖七千多个跨十五种非洲语言的问题和答案对。研究发现开源大模型在这些文化中的表现不佳，在原生语言或语音查询时开放生成的问题回答几乎完全没有准确性。


<details>

Motivation: 由于非洲拥有世界三分之一以上的语言，但AI研究中对此却明显不足。通过创建Afri-MCQA基准测试，旨在填补这一空白，并为跨语言文化知识的传递提供支持，推动非洲语言的包容性多模态AI开发。

Method: 该研究通过创建Afri-MCQA基准测试，收集并整理了来自十二个国家的十五种非洲语言的文化问题和答案对，包括文本和语音模态的平行问题答案对。所有数据由原生语言的说话者提供，以评估大规模语言模型在文化知识和语言能力方面的表现。

Result: 研究结果表明，开源大语言模型在Afri-MCQA基准测试中的表现不佳，尤其是在使用原生语言或语音查询时，开放生成的问答几乎没有任何准确性。此外，还观察到在文本和语音模态下，原生语言的表现显著低于英语。

Conclusion: 该研究结论强调了需要采取语音优先的方法，进行文化扎根的预训练以及跨语言文化的转移学习，以期在非洲语言中促进更包容的多模态AI发展。

Abstract: Africa is home to over one-third of the world's languages, yet remains underrepresented in AI research. We introduce Afri-MCQA, the first Multilingual Cultural Question-Answering benchmark covering 7.5k Q&A pairs across 15 African languages from 12 countries. The benchmark offers parallel English-African language Q&A pairs across text and speech modalities and was entirely created by native speakers. Benchmarking large language models (LLMs) on Afri-MCQA shows that open-weight models perform poorly across evaluated cultures, with near-zero accuracy on open-ended VQA when queried in native language or speech. To evaluate linguistic competence, we include control experiments meant to assess this specific aspect separate from cultural knowledge, and we observe significant performance gaps between native languages and English for both text and speech. These findings underscore the need for speech-first approaches, culturally grounded pretraining, and cross-lingual cultural transfer. To support more inclusive multimodal AI development in African languages, we release our Afri-MCQA under academic license or CC BY-NC 4.0 on HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Atnafu/Afri-MCQA)

TL;DR: 本研究利用多模态上下文学习（MICL）提高自动语音识别（ASR）的性能，尤其适用于未见过的语言。研究发现，跨语言迁移学习可以提高MICL的效率，而基于提示的ASR在未见过的语言上表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动语音识别（ASR）在世界上的许多语言中仍不普及，主要是因为监督数据的稀缺。本研究旨在探索多模态上下文学习（MICL）是否可以用于让语音语言模型学习未见过的语言，并将其应用于ASR改善。

Method: 本研究采用了两个语音语言模型Phi-4和Qwen3-Omni，在三种不同的濒危语言上进行了实验。通过对比分析，研究发现跨语言迁移学习提高了MICL的效率，而基于提示的ASR在未见过的语言上表现较差。

Result: 研究结果表明，MICL在未见过的语言上的ASR性能有明显的提升，而且跨语言迁移学习在无需使用目标语言数据的情况下匹配或超越了基于语料库的语言模型的性能。

Conclusion: 研究最终提出了一种基于MICL的简单ASR系统，该系统结合了更强的声学模型和语音语言模型，以增强未知语言的ASR性能。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) still covers only a small fraction of the world's languages, mainly due to supervised data scarcity. In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) addresses this problem, but prior work largely focuses on high-resource languages covered during training and text-only settings. This paper investigates whether speech LLMs can learn unseen languages with multimodal ICL (MICL), and how this learning can be used to improve ASR. We conduct experiments with two speech LLMs, Phi-4 and Qwen3-Omni, on three diverse endangered languages. Firstly, we find that MICL is effective for unseen languages, leveraging both speech and text modalities. We further show that cross-lingual transfer learning improves MICL efficiency on target languages without training on them. Moreover, we analyze attention patterns to interpret MICL mechanisms, and we observe layer-dependent preferences between audio and text context, with an overall bias towards text. Finally, we show that prompt-based ASR with speech LLMs performs poorly on unseen languages, motivating a simple ASR system that combines a stronger acoustic model with a speech LLM via MICL-based selection of acoustic hypotheses. Results show that MICL consistently improves ASR performance, and that cross-lingual transfer learning matches or outperforms corpus-trained language models without using target-language data. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) represent natural language is a central challenge in natural language processing (NLP) research. Many existing methods extract word embeddings from an LLM, visualise the embedding space via point-plots, and compare the relative positions of certain words. However, this approach only considers single words and not whole natural language expressions, thus disregards the context in which a word is used. Here we present a novel tool for analysing and visualising information flow in natural language expressions by applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to word embeddings. We find that DTI reveals how information flows between word embeddings. Tracking information flows within the layers of an LLM allows for comparing different model structures and revealing opportunities for pruning an LLM's under-utilised layers. Furthermore, our model reveals differences in information flows for tasks like pronoun resolution and metaphor detection. Our results show that our model permits novel insights into how LLMs represent actual natural language expressions, extending the comparison of isolated word embeddings and improving the interpretability of NLP models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for everyday communication tasks, including drafting interpersonal messages intended to influence and persuade. Prior work has shown that LLMs can successfully persuade humans and amplify persuasive language. It is therefore essential to understand how user instructions affect the generation of persuasive language, and to understand whether the generated persuasive language differs, for example, when targeting different groups. In this work, we propose a framework for evaluating how persuasive language generation is affected by recipient gender, sender intent, or output language. We evaluate 13 LLMs and 16 languages using pairwise prompt instructions. We evaluate model responses on 19 categories of persuasive language using an LLM-as-judge setup grounded in social psychology and communication science. Our results reveal significant gender differences in the persuasive language generated across all models. These patterns reflect biases consistent with gender-stereotypical linguistic tendencies documented in social psychology and sociolinguistics.

Abstract: We introduce AutoMonitor-Bench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the reliability of LLM-based misbehavior monitors across diverse tasks and failure modes. AutoMonitor-Bench consists of 3,010 carefully annotated test samples spanning question answering, code generation, and reasoning, with paired misbehavior and benign instances. We evaluate monitors using two complementary metrics: Miss Rate (MR) and False Alarm Rate (FAR), capturing failures to detect misbehavior and oversensitivity to benign behavior, respectively. Evaluating 12 proprietary and 10 open-source LLMs, we observe substantial variability in monitoring performance and a consistent trade-off between MR and FAR, revealing an inherent safety-utility tension. To further explore the limits of monitor reliability, we construct a large-scale training corpus of 153,581 samples and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruction to investigate whether training on known, relatively easy-to-construct misbehavior datasets improves monitoring performance on unseen and more implicit misbehaviors. Our results highlight the challenges of reliable, scalable misbehavior monitoring and motivate future work on task-aware designing and training strategies for LLM-based monitors.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Exposing latent lexical overlap, script romanization has emerged as an effective strategy for improving cross-lingual transfer (XLT) in multilingual language models (mLMs). Most prior work, however, focused on setups that favor romanization the most: (1) transfer from high-resource Latin-script to low-resource non-Latin-script languages and/or (2) between genealogically closely related languages with different scripts. It thus remains unclear whether romanization is a good representation choice for pretraining general-purpose mLMs, or, more precisely, if information loss associated with romanization harms performance for high-resource languages. We address this gap by pretraining encoder LMs from scratch on both romanized and original texts for six typologically diverse high-resource languages, investigating two potential sources of degradation: (i) loss of script-specific information and (ii) negative cross-lingual interference from increased vocabulary overlap. Using two romanizers with different fidelity profiles, we observe negligible performance loss for languages with segmental scripts, whereas languages with morphosyllabic scripts (Chinese and Japanese) suffer degradation that higher-fidelity romanization mitigates but cannot fully recover. Importantly, comparing monolingual LMs with their mLM counterpart, we find no evidence that increased subword overlap induces negative interference. We further show that romanization improves encoding efficiency (i.e., fertility) for segmental scripts at a negligible performance cost.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable strong text generation, and in general there is a practical tradeoff between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. We introduce Simplify-This, a comparative study evaluating both paradigms for text simplification with encoder-decoder LLMs across multiple benchmarks, using a range of evaluation metrics. Fine-tuned models consistently deliver stronger structural simplification, whereas prompting often attains higher semantic similarity scores yet tends to copy inputs. A human evaluation favors fine-tuned outputs overall. We release code, a cleaned derivative dataset used in our study, checkpoints of fine-tuned models, and prompt templates to facilitate reproducibility and future work.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are expected to be trained to act as agents in various real-world environments, but this process relies on rich and varied tool-interaction sandboxes. However, access to real systems is often restricted; LLM-simulated environments are prone to hallucinations and inconsistencies; and manually built sandboxes are hard to scale. In this paper, we propose EnvScaler, an automated framework for scalable tool-interaction environments via programmatic synthesis. EnvScaler comprises two components. First, SkelBuilder constructs diverse environment skeletons through topic mining, logic modeling, and quality evaluation. Then, ScenGenerator generates multiple task scenarios and rule-based trajectory validation functions for each environment. With EnvScaler, we synthesize 191 environments and about 7K scenarios, and apply them to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Qwen3 series models. Results on three benchmarks show that EnvScaler significantly improves LLMs' ability to solve tasks in complex environments involving multi-turn, multi-tool interactions. We release our code and data at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/EnvScaler.

Abstract: The scientific community needs tools that help early-stage researchers effectively communicate their findings and innovations to the public. Although existing general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist in this endeavor, they are not optimally aligned for it. To address this, we propose a framework for training LLMs to emulate the role of a science journalist that can be used by early-stage researchers to learn how to properly communicate their papers to the general public. We evaluate the usefulness of our trained LLM Journalists in leading conversations with both simulated and human researchers. %compared to the general-purpose ones. Our experiments indicate that LLMs trained using our framework ask more relevant questions that address the societal impact of research, prompting researchers to clarify and elaborate on their findings. In the user study, the majority of participants who interacted with our trained LLM Journalist appreciated it more than interacting with general-purpose LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based summarization and text generation are increasingly used for producing and rewriting text, raising concerns about political framing in journalism where subtle wording choices can shape interpretation. Across nine state-of-the-art LLMs, we study political framing by testing whether LLMs' classification-based bias signals align with framing behavior in their generated summaries. We first compare few-shot ideology predictions against LEFT/CENTER/RIGHT labels. We then generate "steered" summaries under FAITHFUL, CENTRIST, LEFT, and RIGHT prompts, and score all outputs using a single fixed ideology evaluator. We find pervasive ideological center-collapse in both article-level ratings and generated text, indicating a systematic tendency toward centrist framing. Among evaluated models, Grok 4 is by far the most ideologically expressive generator, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Llama 3.1 achieve the strongest bias-rating performance among commercial and open-weight models, respectively.

Abstract: Digital twins -- virtual replicas of physical entities -- are gaining traction in healthcare for personalized monitoring, predictive modeling, and clinical decision support. However, generating interoperable patient digital twins from unstructured electronic health records (EHRs) remains challenging due to variability in clinical documentation and lack of standardized mappings. This paper presents a semantic NLP-driven pipeline that transforms free-text EHR notes into FHIR-compliant digital twin representations. The pipeline leverages named entity recognition (NER) to extract clinical concepts, concept normalization to map entities to SNOMED-CT or ICD-10, and relation extraction to capture structured associations between conditions, medications, and observations. Evaluation on MIMIC-IV Clinical Database Demo with validation against MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR reference mappings demonstrates high F1-scores for entity and relation extraction, with improved schema completeness and interoperability compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Real-time multimodal auto-completion is essential for digital assistants, chatbots, design tools, and healthcare consultations, where user inputs rely on shared visual context. We introduce Multimodal Auto-Completion (MAC), a task that predicts upcoming characters in live chats using partially typed text and visual cues. Unlike traditional text-only auto-completion (TAC), MAC grounds predictions in multimodal context to better capture user intent. To enable this task, we adapt MMDialog and ImageChat to create benchmark datasets. We evaluate leading vision-language models (VLMs) against strong textual baselines, highlighting trade-offs in accuracy and efficiency. We present Router-Suggest, a router framework that dynamically selects between textual models and VLMs based on dialog context, along with a lightweight variant for resource-constrained environments. Router-Suggest achieves a 2.3x to 10x speedup over the best-performing VLM. A user study shows that VLMs significantly excel over textual models on user satisfaction, notably saving user typing effort and improving the quality of completions in multi-turn conversations. These findings underscore the need for multimodal context in auto-completions, leading to smarter, user-aware assistants.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated competitive performance in zero-shot multilingual machine translation (MT). Some follow-up works further improved MT performance via preference optimization, but they leave a key aspect largely underexplored: the order in which data samples are given during training. We address this topic by integrating curriculum learning into various state-of-the-art preference optimization algorithms to boost MT performance. We introduce a novel curriculum learning strategy with restarts (CLewR), which reiterates easy-to-hard curriculum multiple times during training to effectively mitigate the catastrophic forgetting of easy examples. We demonstrate consistent gains across several model families (Gemma2, Qwen2.5, Llama3.1) and preference optimization techniques.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the growth of interpreting technologies, from remote interpreting and Computer-Aided Interpreting to automated speech translation and interpreting avatars, there is now a high demand for ways to quickly and efficiently measure the quality of any interpreting delivered. A range of approaches to fulfil the need for quick and efficient quality measurement have been proposed, each involving some measure of automation. This article examines these recently-proposed quality measurement methods and will discuss their suitability for measuring the quality of authentic interpreting practice, whether delivered by humans or machines, concluding that automatic metrics as currently proposed cannot take into account the communicative context and thus are not viable measures of the quality of any interpreting provision when used on their own. Across all attempts to measure or even categorise quality in Interpreting Studies, the contexts in which interpreting takes place have become fundamental to the final analysis.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models are critically undermined by citation hallucinations, a deceptive failure where a model confidently cites a source that fails to support its claim. Existing work often attributes hallucination to a simple over-reliance on the model's parametric knowledge. We challenge this view and introduce FACTUM (Framework for Attesting Citation Trustworthiness via Underlying Mechanisms), a framework of four mechanistic scores measuring the distinct contributions of a model's attention and FFN pathways, and the alignment between them. Our analysis reveals two consistent signatures of correct citation: a significantly stronger contribution from the model's parametric knowledge and greater use of the attention sink for information synthesis. Crucially, we find the signature of a correct citation is not static but evolves with model scale. For example, the signature of a correct citation for the Llama-3.2-3B model is marked by higher pathway alignment, whereas for the Llama-3.1-8B model, it is characterized by lower alignment, where pathways contribute more distinct, orthogonal information. By capturing this complex, evolving signature, FACTUM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 37.5% in AUC. Our findings reframe citation hallucination as a complex, scale-dependent interplay between internal mechanisms, paving the way for more nuanced and reliable RAG systems.

Abstract: Modelling a language model for a multi-lingual scenario includes several potential challenges, among which catastrophic forgetting is the major challenge. For example, small language models (SLM) built for low-resource languages by adapting large language models (LLMs) pose the challenge of catastrophic forgetting. This work proposes to employ a continual learning strategy using parts-of-speech (POS)-based code-switching along with a replay adapter strategy to mitigate the identified gap of catastrophic forgetting while training SLM from LLM. Experiments conducted on vision language tasks such as visual question answering and language modelling task exhibits the success of the proposed architecture.

Abstract: Recent work shows that large multimodal models (LMMs) can self-improve from unlabeled data via self-play and intrinsic feedback. Yet existing self-evolving frameworks mainly reward final outcomes, leaving intermediate reasoning weakly constrained despite its importance for visually grounded decision making. We propose iReasoner, a self-evolving framework that improves an LMM's implicit reasoning by explicitly eliciting chain-of-thought (CoT) and rewarding its internal agreement. In a Proposer--Solver loop over unlabeled images, iReasoner augments outcome-level intrinsic rewards with a trajectory-aware signal defined over intermediate reasoning steps, providing learning signals that distinguish reasoning paths leading to the same answer without ground-truth labels or external judges. Starting from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, iReasoner yields up to $+2.1$ points across diverse multimodal reasoning benchmarks under fully unsupervised post-training. We hope this work serves as a starting point for reasoning-aware self-improvement in LMMs in purely unsupervised settings.

Abstract: Access to justice remains limited for many people, leading laypersons to increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for legal self-help. Laypeople use these tools intuitively, which may lead them to form expectations based on incomplete, incorrect, or biased outputs. This study examines whether leading LLMs exhibit gender bias in their responses to a realistic family law scenario. We present an expert-designed divorce scenario grounded in Czech family law and evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-5 nano, Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Llama 3.3 in a fully zero-shot interaction. We deploy two versions of the scenario, one with gendered names and one with neutral labels, to establish a baseline for comparison. We further introduce nine legally relevant factors that vary the factual circumstances of the case and test whether these variations influence the models' proposed shared-parenting ratios. Our preliminary results highlight differences across models and suggest gender-dependent patterns in the outcomes generated by some systems. The findings underscore both the risks associated with laypeople's reliance on LLMs for legal guidance and the need for more robust evaluation of model behavior in sensitive legal contexts. We present exploratory and descriptive evidence intended to identify systematic asymmetries rather than to establish causal effects.

Abstract: Preference tuning aligns pretrained language models to human judgments of quality, helpfulness, or safety by optimizing over explicit preference signals rather than likelihood alone. Prior work has shown that preference-tuning degrades performance and reduces helpfulness when evaluated outside the training domain. However, the extent to which adaptation strategies mitigate this domain shift remains unexplored. We address this challenge by conducting a comprehensive and systematic study of alignment generalization under domain shift. We compare five popular alignment objectives and various adaptation strategies from source to target, including target-domain supervised fine-tuning and pseudo-labeling, across summarization and question-answering helpfulness tasks. Our findings reveal systematic differences in generalization across alignment objectives under domain shift. We show that adaptation strategies based on pseudo-labeling can substantially reduce domain-shift degradation

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) routing aims to exploit the specialized strengths of different LLMs for diverse tasks. However, existing approaches typically focus on selecting LLM architectures while overlooking parameter settings, which are critical for task performance. In this paper, we introduce HAPS, a hierarchical LLM routing framework that jointly searches over model architectures and parameters. Specifically, we use a high-level router to select among candidate LLM architectures, and then search for the optimal parameters for the selected architectures based on a low-level router. We design a parameter generation network to share parameters between the two routers to mutually enhance their capabilities. In the training process, we design a reward-augmented objective to effectively optimize our framework. Experiments on two commonly used benchmarks show that HAPS consistently outperforms strong routing baselines. We have released our code at https://github.com/zihangtian/HAPS.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world settings, correctness alone is insufficient. Reliable deployment requires maintaining truthful beliefs under contextual perturbations. Existing evaluations largely rely on point-wise confidence like Self-Consistency, which can mask brittle belief. We show that even facts answered with perfect self-consistency can rapidly collapse under mild contextual interference. To address this gap, we propose Neighbor-Consistency Belief (NCB), a structural measure of belief robustness that evaluates response coherence across a conceptual neighborhood. To validate the efficiency of NCB, we introduce a new cognitive stress-testing protocol that probes outputs stability under contextual interference. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that the performance of high-NCB data is relatively more resistant to interference. Finally, we present Structure-Aware Training (SAT), which optimizes context-invariant belief structure and reduces long-tail knowledge brittleness by approximately 30%. Code will be available at https://github.com/zjunlp/belief.

Abstract: We release Pantagruel models, a new family of self-supervised encoder models for French text and speech. Instead of predicting modality-tailored targets such as textual tokens or speech units, Pantagruel learns contextualized target representations in the feature space, allowing modality-specific encoders to capture linguistic and acoustic regularities more effectively. Separate models are pre-trained on large-scale French corpora, including Wikipedia, OSCAR and CroissantLLM for text, together with MultilingualLibriSpeech, LeBenchmark, and INA-100k for speech. INA-100k is a newly introduced 100,000-hour corpus of French audio derived from the archives of the Institut National de l'Audiovisuel (INA), the national repository of French radio and television broadcasts, providing highly diverse audio data. We evaluate Pantagruel across a broad range of downstream tasks spanning both modalities, including those from the standard French benchmarks such as FLUE or LeBenchmark. Across these tasks, Pantagruel models show competitive or superior performance compared to strong French baselines such as CamemBERT, FlauBERT, and LeBenchmark2.0, while maintaining a shared architecture that can seamlessly handle either speech or text inputs. These results confirm the effectiveness of feature-space self-supervised objectives for French representation learning and highlight Pantagruel as a robust foundation for multimodal speech-text understanding.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Autonomous machine learning agents have revolutionized scientific discovery, yet they remain constrained by a Generate-Execute-Feedback paradigm. Previous approaches suffer from a severe Execution Bottleneck, as hypothesis evaluation relies strictly on expensive physical execution. To bypass these physical constraints, we internalize execution priors to substitute costly runtime checks with instantaneous predictive reasoning, drawing inspiration from World Models. In this work, we formalize the task of Data-centric Solution Preference and construct a comprehensive corpus of 18,438 pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate that LLMs exhibit significant predictive capabilities when primed with a Verified Data Analysis Report, achieving 61.5% accuracy and robust confidence calibration. Finally, we instantiate this framework in FOREAGENT, an agent that employs a Predict-then-Verify loop, achieving a 6x acceleration in convergence while surpassing execution-based baselines by +6%. Our code and dataset will be publicly available soon at https://github.com/zjunlp/predict-before-execute.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to learn effective long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) reasoning from human or non-Long-CoT LLMs imitation. To understand this, we propose that effective and learnable Long CoT trajectories feature stable molecular-like structures in unified view, which are formed by three interaction types: Deep-Reasoning (covalent-like), Self-Reflection (hydrogen-bond-like), and Self-Exploration (van der Waals-like). Analysis of distilled trajectories reveals these structures emerge from Long CoT fine-tuning, not keyword imitation. We introduce Effective Semantic Isomers and show that only bonds promoting fast entropy convergence support stable Long CoT learning, while structural competition impairs training. Drawing on these findings, we present Mole-Syn, a distribution-transfer-graph method that guides synthesis of effective Long CoT structures, boosting performance and RL stability across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have enabled complex multi-turn agentic tasks requiring extensive tool calling, where conversations can span dozens of API calls with increasingly large context windows. However, although major LLM providers offer prompt caching to reduce cost and latency, its benefits for agentic workloads remain underexplored in the research literature. To our knowledge, no prior work quantifies these cost savings or compares caching strategies for multi-turn agentic tasks. We present a comprehensive evaluation of prompt caching across three major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) and compare three caching strategies, including full context caching, system prompt only caching, and caching that excludes dynamic tool results. We evaluate on DeepResearchBench, a multi-turn agentic benchmark where agents autonomously execute real-world web search tool calls to answer complex research questions, measuring both API cost and time to first token (TTFT) across over 500 agent sessions with 10,000-token system prompts. Our results demonstrate that prompt caching reduces API costs by 45-80% and improves time to first token by 13-31% across providers. We find that strategic prompt cache block control, such as placing dynamic content at the end of the system prompt, avoiding dynamic traditional function calling, and excluding dynamic tool results, provides more consistent benefits than naive full-context caching, which can paradoxically increase latency. Our analysis reveals nuanced variations in caching behavior across providers, and we provide practical guidance for implementing prompt caching in production agentic systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing LLM-based deep search agents. However, existing approaches primarily rely on binary outcome rewards, which fail to capture the comprehensiveness and factuality of agents' reasoning process, and often lead to undesirable behaviors such as shortcut exploitation and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Citation-aware Rubric Rewards (CaRR)}, a fine-grained reward framework for deep search agents that emphasizes reasoning comprehensiveness, factual grounding, and evidence connectivity. CaRR decomposes complex questions into verifiable single-hop rubrics and requires agents to satisfy these rubrics by explicitly identifying hidden entities, supporting them with correct citations, and constructing complete evidence chains that link to the predicted answer. We further introduce \textbf{Citation-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)}, which combines CaRR and outcome rewards for training robust deep search agents. Experiments show that C-GRPO consistently outperforms standard outcome-based RL baselines across multiple deep search benchmarks. Our analysis also validates that C-GRPO effectively discourages shortcut exploitation, promotes comprehensive, evidence-grounded reasoning, and exhibits strong generalization to open-ended deep research tasks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/THUDM/CaRR.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths arising from differences in pretraining data, model architectures, and decoding behaviors. Inference-time ensembling provides a practical way to combine these capabilities without retraining. However, existing ensemble approaches suffer from fundamental limitations. Most rely on fixed fusion granularity, which lacks the flexibility required for mid-generation adaptation and fails to adapt to different generation characteristics across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AdaFuse, an adaptive ensemble decoding framework that dynamically selects semantically appropriate fusion units during generation. Rather than committing to a fixed granularity, AdaFuse adjusts fusion behavior on the fly based on the decoding context, with words serving as basic building blocks for alignment. To be specific, we introduce an uncertainty-based criterion to decide whether to apply ensembling at each decoding step. Under confident decoding states, the model continues generation directly. In less certain states, AdaFuse invokes a diversity-aware scaling strategy to explore alternative candidate continuations and inform ensemble decisions. This design establishes a synergistic interaction between adaptive ensembling and test-time scaling, where ensemble decisions guide targeted exploration, and the resulting diversity in turn strengthens ensemble quality. Experiments on open-domain question answering, arithmetic reasoning, and machine translation demonstrate that AdaFuse consistently outperforms strong ensemble baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 6.88%. The code is available at https://github.com/CCM0111/AdaFuse.

Conclusion: 此项工作建立了一个由知识图增补的LLM统一管道，用于知识表示、方程式为中心的推理和基于信心的外推评估，强调了知识图增补的LLM在添加剂制造中的可靠外推建模潜力。

Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) relies critically on understanding and extrapolating process-property relationships; however, existing data-driven approaches remain limited by fragmented knowledge representations and unreliable extrapolation under sparse data conditions. In this study, we propose an ontology-guided, equation-centric framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs) with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge graph (AM-MKG) to enable reliable knowledge extraction and principled extrapolative modeling. By explicitly encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and their semantic relationships within a formal ontology, unstructured literature is transformed into machine-interpretable representations that support structured querying and reasoning. LLM-based equation generation is further conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs, enforcing physically meaningful functional forms and mitigating non-physical or unstable extrapolation trends. To assess reliability beyond conventional predictive uncertainty, a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment is introduced, integrating extrapolation distance, statistical stability, and knowledge-graph-based physical consistency into a unified confidence score. Results demonstrate that ontology-guided extraction significantly improves the structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs. Overall, this work establishes a unified pipeline for ontology-driven knowledge representation, equation-centered reasoning, and confidence-based extrapolation assessment, highlighting the potential of knowledge-graph-augmented LLMs as reliable tools for extrapolative modeling in additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Predicting enzyme-substrate interactions has long been a fundamental problem in biochemistry and metabolic engineering. While existing methods could leverage databases of expert-curated enzyme-substrate pairs for models to learn from known pair interactions, the databases are often sparse, i.e., there are only limited and incomplete examples of such pairs, and also labor-intensive to maintain. This lack of sufficient training data significantly hinders the ability of traditional enzyme prediction models to generalize to unseen interactions. In this work, we try to exploit chemical reaction equations from domain-specific databases, given their easier accessibility and denser, more abundant data. However, interactions of multiple compounds, e.g., educts and products, with the same enzymes create complex relational data patterns that traditional models cannot easily capture. To tackle that, we represent chemical reaction equations as triples of (educt, enzyme, product) within a knowledge graph, such that we can take advantage of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to infer missing enzyme-substrate pairs for graph completion. Particularly, in order to capture intricate relationships among compounds, we propose our knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model for enzyme prediction, i.e., Hyper-Enz, which integrates a hypergraph transformer with a KGE model to learn representations of the hyper-edges that involve multiple educts and products. Also, a multi-expert paradigm is introduced to guide the learning of enzyme-substrate interactions with both the proposed model and chemical reaction equations. Experimental results show a significant improvement, with up to a 88% relative improvement in average enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction compared to traditional models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Persona conditioning can be viewed as a behavioral prior for large language models (LLMs) and is often assumed to confer expertise and improve safety in a monotonic manner. However, its effects on high-stakes clinical decision-making remain poorly characterized. We systematically evaluate persona-based control in clinical LLMs, examining how professional roles (e.g., Emergency Department physician, nurse) and interaction styles (bold vs.\ cautious) influence behavior across models and medical tasks. We assess performance on clinical triage and patient-safety tasks using multidimensional evaluations that capture task accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant risk behavior. We find systematic, context-dependent, and non-monotonic effects: Medical personas improve performance in critical care tasks, yielding gains of up to $\sim+20\%$ in accuracy and calibration, but degrade performance in primary-care settings by comparable margins. Interaction style modulates risk propensity and sensitivity, but it's highly model-dependent. While aggregated LLM-judge rankings favor medical over non-medical personas in safety-critical cases, we found that human clinicians show moderate agreement on safety compliance (average Cohen's $κ= 0.43$) but indicate a low confidence in 95.9\% of their responses on reasoning quality. Our work shows that personas function as behavioral priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs rather than guarantees of safety or expertise.

Abstract: As AI agents increasingly operate in multi-agent environments, understanding their collective behavior becomes critical for predicting the dynamics of artificial societies. This study examines conformity, the tendency to align with group opinions under social pressure, in large multimodal language models functioning as AI agents. By adapting classic visual experiments from social psychology, we investigate how AI agents respond to group influence as social actors. Our experiments reveal that AI agents exhibit a systematic conformity bias, aligned with Social Impact Theory, showing sensitivity to group size, unanimity, task difficulty, and source characteristics. Critically, AI agents achieving near-perfect performance in isolation become highly susceptible to manipulation through social influence. This vulnerability persists across model scales: while larger models show reduced conformity on simple tasks due to improved capabilities, they remain vulnerable when operating at their competence boundary. These findings reveal fundamental security vulnerabilities in AI agent decision-making that could enable malicious manipulation, misinformation campaigns, and bias propagation in multi-agent systems, highlighting the urgent need for safeguards in collective AI deployments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful candidates for complex decision-making, leveraging vast encoded knowledge and remarkable zero-shot abilities. However, their adoption in high-stakes environments is hindered by their opacity; their outputs lack faithful explanations and cannot be effectively contested to correct errors, undermining trustworthiness. In this paper, we propose ART (Adaptive Reasoning Trees), a hierarchical method for claim verification. The process begins with a root claim, which branches into supporting and attacking child arguments. An argument's strength is determined bottom-up via a pairwise tournament of its children, adjudicated by a judge LLM, allowing a final, transparent and contestable verdict to be systematically derived which is missing in methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). We empirically validate ART on multiple datasets, analyzing different argument generators and comparison strategies. Our findings show that ART's structured reasoning outperforms strong baselines, establishing a new benchmark for explainable claim verification which is more reliable and ensures clarity in the overall decision making step.

Abstract: Benchmarking the relative capabilities of AI systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Models, typically ignores the impact of uncertainty in the underlying ground truth answers from experts. This ambiguity is particularly consequential in medicine where uncertainty is pervasive. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic paradigm to theoretically explain how high certainty in ground truth answers is almost always necessary for even an expert to achieve high scores, whereas in datasets with high variation in ground truth answers there may be little difference between a random labeller and an expert. Therefore, ignoring uncertainty in ground truth evaluation data can result in the misleading conclusion that a non-expert has similar performance to that of an expert. Using the probabilistic paradigm, we thus bring forth the concepts of expected accuracy and expected F1 to estimate the score an expert human or system can achieve given ground truth answer variability.
  Our work leads to the recommendation that when establishing the capability of a system, results should be stratified by probability of the ground truth answer, typically measured by the agreement rate of ground truth experts. Stratification becomes critical when the overall performance drops below a threshold of 80%. Under stratified evaluation, performance comparison becomes more reliable in high certainty bins, mitigating the effect of the key confounding factor -- uncertainty.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence now outperforms humans in several scientific and engineering tasks, yet its internal representations often remain opaque. In this Perspective, we argue that explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), combined with causal reasoning, enables {\it learning from the learners}. Focusing on discovery, optimization and certification, we show how the combination of foundation models and explainability methods allows the extraction of causal mechanisms, guides robust design and control, and supports trust and accountability in high-stakes applications. We discuss challenges in faithfulness, generalization and usability of explanations, and propose XAI as a unifying framework for human-AI collaboration in science and engineering.

Abstract: One mistake by an AI system in a safety-critical setting can cost lives. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how "rare" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language model (LLM) reasoning has focused on domains like mathematics and coding, where abundant high-quality data and objective evaluation metrics are readily available. In contrast, progress in LLM reasoning models remains limited in scientific domains such as medicine and materials science due to limited dataset coverage and the inherent complexity of open-ended scientific questions. To address these challenges, we introduce WildSci, a new dataset of domain-specific science questions automatically synthesized from peer-reviewed literature, covering 9 scientific disciplines and 26 subdomains. By framing complex scientific reasoning tasks in a multiple-choice format, we enable scalable training with well-defined reward signals. We further apply reinforcement learning to finetune models on these data and analyze the resulting training dynamics, including domain-specific performance changes, response behaviors, and generalization trends. Experiments on a suite of scientific benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and approach. We release WildSci to enable scalable and sustainable research in scientific reasoning, available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/JustinTX/WildSci.

Abstract: Standard safety alignment optimizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for universal helpfulness and honesty, effectively instilling a rigid "Boy Scout" morality. While robust for general-purpose assistants, this one-size-fits-all ethical framework imposes a "transparency tax" on professional domains requiring strategic ambiguity and information withholding, such as public relations, negotiation, and crisis management. To measure this gap between general safety and professional utility, we introduce Crisis-Bench, a multi-agent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that evaluates LLMs in high-stakes corporate crises. Spanning 80 diverse storylines across 8 industries, Crisis-Bench tasks an LLM-based Public Relations (PR) Agent with navigating a dynamic 7-day corporate crisis simulation while managing strictly separated Private and Public narrative states to enforce rigorous information asymmetry. Unlike traditional benchmarks that rely on static ground truths, we introduce the Adjudicator-Market Loop: a novel evaluation metric where public sentiment is adjudicated and translated into a simulated stock price, creating a realistic economic incentive structure. Our results expose a critical dichotomy: while some models capitulate to ethical concerns, others demonstrate the capacity for Machiavellian, legitimate strategic withholding in order to stabilize the simulated stock price. Crisis-Bench provides the first quantitative framework for assessing "Reputation Management" capabilities, arguing for a shift from rigid moral absolutism to context-aware professional alignment.

Abstract: E-commerce platforms and payment solution providers face increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes, ranging from identity theft and account takeovers to complex money laundering operations that exploit the speed and anonymity of digital transactions. However, despite their theoretical promise, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to fraud detection in real-world financial contexts remains largely unexploited, and their practical effectiveness in handling domain-specific e-commerce transaction data has yet to be empirically validated. To bridge this gap between conventional machine learning limitations and the untapped potential of LLMs in fraud detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to post-train lightweight language models specifically for fraud detection tasks using only raw transaction data. We utilize the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm combined with a rule-based reward system to fine-tune language models of various sizes on a real-life transaction dataset provided by a Chinese global payment solution company. Through this reinforcement learning framework, the language models are encouraged to explore diverse trust and risk signals embedded within the textual transaction data, including patterns in customer information, shipping details, product descriptions, and order history. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with post-trained language models achieving substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data. Our findings demonstrate that the observed performance improvements are primarily attributable to the exploration mechanism inherent in reinforcement learning, which allows models to discover novel fraud indicators beyond those captured by traditional engineered features.

Abstract: In web search and recommendation systems, user clicks are widely used to train ranking models. However, click data is heavily biased, i.e., users tend to click higher-ranked items (position bias), choose only what was shown to them (selection bias), and trust top results more (trust bias). Without explicitly modeling these biases, the true relevance of ranked items cannot be correctly learned from clicks. Existing Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods mainly correct position bias and rely on propensity estimation, but they cannot measure remaining bias, provide risk guarantees, or jointly handle multiple bias sources. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel causal learning-based ranking framework that extends ULTR by combining Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with information-theoretic tools. SCMs specify how clicks are generated and help identify the true relevance signal from click data, while conditional mutual information, measures how much bias leaks into the
  learned relevance estimates. We use this leakage measure to define a rigorous notion of disentanglement and include it as a regularizer during model training to reduce bias. In addition, we incorporate a causal inference estimator, i.e., doubly robust estimator, to ensure more reliable risk estimation. Experiments on standard Learning-to-Rank benchmarks show that our method consistently reduces measured bias leakage and improves ranking performance, especially in realistic scenarios where multiple biases-such as position and trust bias-interact strongly.

Abstract: Conventional Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods aim to infer missing information in incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing information, which struggle to perform effectively in scenarios involving emerging entities. Inductive KGC methods can handle the emerging entities and relations in KGs, offering greater dynamic adaptability. While existing inductive KGC methods have achieved some success, they also face challenges, such as susceptibility to noisy structural information during reasoning and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies in reasoning paths. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Cumulative Path-Level Semantic Reasoning for inductive knowledge graph completion (CPSR) framework, which simultaneously captures both the structural and semantic information of KGs to enhance the inductive KGC task. Specifically, the proposed CPSR employs a query-dependent masking module to adaptively mask noisy structural information while retaining important information closely related to the targets. Additionally, CPSR introduces a global semantic scoring module that evaluates both the individual contributions and the collective impact of nodes along the reasoning path within KGs. The experimental results demonstrate that CPSR achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: As generative models become ubiquitous, there is a critical need for fine-grained control over the generation process. Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting. This highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting the focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits.

Abstract: High-fidelity agent initialization is crucial for credible Agent-Based Modeling across diverse domains. A robust framework should be Topic-Adaptive, capturing macro-level joint distributions while ensuring micro-level individual rationality. Existing approaches fall into two categories: static data-based retrieval methods that fail to adapt to unseen topics absent from the data, and LLM-based generation methods that lack macro-level distribution awareness, resulting in inconsistencies between micro-level persona attributes and reality. To address these problems, we propose HAG, a Hierarchical Agent Generation framework that formalizes population generation as a two-stage decision process. Firstly, utilizing a World Knowledge Model to infer hierarchical conditional probabilities to construct the Topic-Adaptive Tree, achieving macro-level distribution alignment. Then, grounded real-world data, instantiation and agentic augmentation are carried out to ensure micro-level consistency. Given the lack of specialized evaluation, we establish a multi-domain benchmark and a comprehensive PACE evaluation framework. Extensive experiments show that HAG significantly outperforms representative baselines, reducing population alignment errors by an average of 37.7% and enhancing sociological consistency by 18.8%.

Abstract: Hybrid action space, which combines discrete choices and continuous parameters, is prevalent in domains such as robot control and game AI. However, efficiently modeling and optimizing hybrid discrete-continuous action space remains a fundamental challenge, mainly due to limited policy expressiveness and poor scalability in high-dimensional settings. To address this challenge, we view the hybrid action space problem as a fully cooperative game and propose a \textbf{Cooperative Hybrid Diffusion Policies (CHDP)} framework to solve it. CHDP employs two cooperative agents that leverage a discrete and a continuous diffusion policy, respectively. The continuous policy is conditioned on the discrete action's representation, explicitly modeling the dependency between them. This cooperative design allows the diffusion policies to leverage their expressiveness to capture complex distributions in their respective action spaces. To mitigate the update conflicts arising from simultaneous policy updates in this cooperative setting, we employ a sequential update scheme that fosters co-adaptation. Moreover, to improve scalability when learning in high-dimensional discrete action space, we construct a codebook that embeds the action space into a low-dimensional latent space. This mapping enables the discrete policy to learn in a compact, structured space. Finally, we design a Q-function-based guidance mechanism to align the codebook's embeddings with the discrete policy's representation during training. On challenging hybrid action benchmarks, CHDP outperforms the state-of-the-art method by up to $19.3\%$ in success rate.

Abstract: Despite the success of test-time scaling, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) frequently encounter repetitive loops that lead to computational waste and inference failure. In this paper, we identify a distinct failure mode termed Circular Reasoning. Unlike traditional model degeneration, this phenomenon manifests as a self-reinforcing trap where generated content acts as a logical premise for its own recurrence, compelling the reiteration of preceding text. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce LoopBench, a dataset designed to capture two distinct loop typologies: numerical loops and statement loops. Mechanistically, we characterize circular reasoning as a state collapse exhibiting distinct boundaries, where semantic repetition precedes textual repetition. We reveal that reasoning impasses trigger the loop onset, which subsequently persists as an inescapable cycle driven by a self-reinforcing V-shaped attention mechanism. Guided by these findings, we employ the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm to capture these precursors for early loop prediction. Experiments across diverse LRMs validate its accuracy and elucidate the stability of long-chain reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and theorem provers (TPs) can be effectively combined for verifiable natural language inference (NLI). However, existing approaches rely on a fixed logical formalism, a feature that limits robustness and adaptability. We propose a logic-parametric framework for neuro-symbolic NLI that treats the underlying logic not as a static background, but as a controllable component. Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains. Our results highlight the value of making logic a first-class, parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures for more robust, modular, and adaptable reasoning.

Abstract: Verification is a key bottleneck in improving inference speed while maintaining distribution fidelity in Speculative Decoding. Recent work has shown that sequence-level verification leads to a higher number of accepted tokens compared to token-wise verification. However, existing solutions often rely on surrogate approximations or are constrained by partial information, struggling with joint intractability. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), a provably lossless verification method that significantly boosts the expected number of accepted tokens and overcomes joint intractability by balancing excess and deficient probability mass across accessible branches. Our extensive large-scale experiments demonstrate that HSD yields consistent improvements in acceptance rates across diverse model families and benchmarks. Moreover, its strong explainability and generality make it readily integrable into a wide range of speculative decoding frameworks. Notably, integrating HSD into EAGLE-3 yields over a 12% performance gain, establishing state-of-the-art decoding efficiency without compromising distribution fidelity.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly integrated into privacy-critical domains, yet existing evaluations of personally identifiable information (PII) leakage largely treat privacy as a static extraction task and ignore how a subject's online presence--the volume of their data available online--influences privacy alignment. We introduce PII-VisBench, a novel benchmark containing 4000 unique probes designed to evaluate VLM safety through the continuum of online presence. The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities. Finally, paraphrasing and jailbreak-style prompts expose attack and model-dependent failures, motivating visibility-aware safety evaluation and training interventions.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), which excel at collaborative decision-making and complex problem-solving. Recently, researchers have further investigated Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) frameworks, which enhance the reasoning and collaboration capabilities of MAS through information exchange and debate among multiple agents. However, existing approaches often rely on unguided initialization, causing agents to adopt identical reasoning paths that lead to the same errors. As a result, effective debate among agents is hindered, and the final outcome frequently degenerates into simple majority voting. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we introduce Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate), which enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent debate through three key mechanisms: (1) Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation, which employs a dedicated Path Generation Agent to generate diverse and logical solution paths with adaptive redundancy; (2) Process-Centric Debate, which shifts the focus from surface-level outcome voting to rigorous step-by-step logic critique to ensure process correctness; (3) A Trigger-Based Verification Agent, which is activated upon disagreement and uses external tools to objectively resolve deadlocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaDebate achieves superior performance across various benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art MAD methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly deployed as computer-use agents (CUAs) that operate desktops and browsers. Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2). On OSWorld-Verified, BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success from 22.87% to 32.13% and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%, with consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems based on large language models, particularly centralized architectures, have recently shown strong potential for complex and knowledge-intensive tasks. However, central agents often suffer from unstable long-horizon collaboration due to the lack of memory management, leading to context bloat, error accumulation, and poor cross-task generalization. To address both task-level memory inefficiency and the inability to reuse coordination experience, we propose StackPlanner, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with explicit memory control. StackPlanner addresses these challenges by decoupling high-level coordination from subtask execution with active task-level memory control, and by learning to retrieve and exploit reusable coordination experience via structured experience memory and reinforcement learning. Experiments on multiple deep-search and agent system benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling reliable long-horizon multi-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a promising paradigm for agents, with long-term planning and decision-making emerging as core general-purpose capabilities for adapting to diverse scenarios and tasks. Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO. By offering a lightweight and multimodal design, TowerMind complements the existing RTS game-based environment landscape and introduces a new benchmark for the AI agent field.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗手术等安全关键领域，语言的模糊性可能导致致命错误。当前大多数AI研究忽视了这一问题，集中于执行而未考虑确认指令。为了弥补这一安全缺口，我们提出了一个新任务——Open-Vocabulary 3D指令歧义检测，旨在保证指令在特定3D场景中的唯一性和明确性。

Method: 我们构建了一个包含700多个3D场景和约22000条指令的大规模基准数据集Ambi3D，以及一个名为AmbiVer的两阶段框架，它利用多视角视觉证据引导视觉-语言模型判断指令的歧义性。

Result: 实验表明，最先进的3D大语言模型在检测指令是否含糊方面表现不佳。AmbiVer框架在多个方面优于基线方法，展示了检测指令歧义性的挑战，并证实了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究不仅定义了新的任务，开发了AmbiVer框架，还为确保3D场景中的指令明确性奠定了基础。这对于开发更加安全和可靠的AI系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains, linguistic ambiguity can have severe consequences; a vague command like "Pass me the vial" in a surgical setting could lead to catastrophic errors. Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a fundamental new task where a model must determine if a command has a single, unambiguous meaning within a given 3D scene. To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions. Our analysis reveals a surprising limitation: state-of-the-art 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reliably determine if an instruction is ambiguous. To address this challenge, we propose AmbiVer, a two-stage framework that collects explicit visual evidence from multiple views and uses it to guide an vision-language model (VLM) in judging instruction ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the challenge of our task and the effectiveness of AmbiVer, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy embodied AI.
