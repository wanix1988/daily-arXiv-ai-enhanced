State-of-the-art approaches decompose the task into a lifting of atomic propositions (APs) phase and a translation phase. However, existing methods struggle with accurate lifting, the existence of co-references, and learning from limited data. In this paper, we propose a framework for NL to TL translation called Grammar Forced Translation (GraFT). The framework is based on the observation that previous work solves both the lifting and translation steps by letting a language model iteratively predict tokens from its full vocabulary. In contrast, GraFT reduces the complexity of both tasks by restricting the set of valid output tokens from the full vocabulary to only a handful in each step. The solution space reduction is obtained by exploiting the unique properties of each problem. We also provide a theoretical justification for why the solution space reduction leads to more efficient learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of GraFT using the CW, GLTL, and Navi benchmarks. Compared with state-of-the-art translation approaches, it can be observed that GraFT the end-to-end translation accuracy by 5.49% and out-of-domain translation accuracy by 14.06% on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "GraFT \u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8f93\u51fa token \u96c6\u5408\u6765\u7b80\u5316\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u65f6\u95f4\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ffb\u8bd1\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u547d\u9898\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u5904\u7406\u5171\u6307\u548c\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "GraFT \u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u9650\u5236\u6709\u6548\u8f93\u51fa token \u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728 CW\u3001GLTL \u548c Navi \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGraFT \u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ffb\u8bd1\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 5.49%\uff0c\u8de8\u57df\u7ffb\u8bd1\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 14.06%\u3002", "conclusion": "GraFT \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3 NL \u5230 TL \u7ffb\u8bd1\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Characterizing How Meaningful Information is Distributed Across Multiple Channels", "comment": null, "summary": "Prosody -- the melody of speech -- conveys critical information often not captured by the words or text of a message. In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic approach to quantify how much information is expressed by prosody alone and not by text, and crucially, what that information is about. Our approach applies large speech and language models to estimate the mutual information between a particular dimension of an utterance's meaning (e.g., its emotion) and any of its communication channels (e.g., audio or text). We then use this approach to quantify how much information is conveyed by audio and text about sarcasm, emotion, and questionhood, using speech from television and podcasts. We find that for sarcasm and emotion the audio channel -- and by implication the prosodic channel -- transmits over an order of magnitude more information about these features than the text channel alone, at least when long-term context beyond the current sentence is unavailable. For questionhood, prosody provides comparatively less additional information. We conclude by outlining a program applying our approach to more dimensions of meaning, communication channels, and languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u975e\u8a00\u8bed\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u8bed\u97f3\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u8bed\u6c14\uff09\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7535\u89c6\u548c\u64ad\u5ba2\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u97f3\u6e20\u9053\u6bd4\u6587\u672c\u6e20\u9053\u4f20\u8f93\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u8bbd\u523a\u548c\u60c5\u7eea\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u591a\u7ea6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u5173\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u6027\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u8bed\u97f3\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u989d\u5916\u4fe1\u606f\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u97f3\uff08Prosody\uff09\u5728\u6c9f\u901a\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5b83\u6240\u4f20\u8fbe\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u6355\u6349\u5230\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u8bbd\u523a\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u610f\u4e49\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u60c5\u611f\uff09\u4e0e\u4efb\u4f55\u901a\u4fe1\u6e20\u9053\uff08\u5982\u97f3\u9891\u6216\u6587\u672c\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u89c6\u548c\u64ad\u5ba2\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u6709\u5173\u8bbd\u523a\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u7591\u95ee\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bbd\u523a\u548c\u60c5\u611f\uff0c\u8bed\u97f3\u6e20\u9053\u2014\u2014\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u542b\u7684\u5bf9\u97f3\u8c03\u3001\u8bed\u6c14\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u2014\u2014\u76f8\u6bd4\u6587\u672c\u6e20\u9053\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u7ea6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7591\u95ee\u6027\uff0c\u8bed\u97f3\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u989d\u5916\u4fe1\u606f\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u542b\u4e49\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u6e20\u9053\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u3002"}}

While existing caching mechanisms,such as token-level key-value caches, offer speedups in autore-gressive decoding, they are limited in scope and applicability. In this paper, we present LLMCache, a novel layer-wise caching framework that accelerates transformer inference by reusing intermediate activations based on semantic similarity of input sequences. Unlike prior work, LLMCache is model-agnostic,operates across both encoder and decoder architectures, and supports caching at arbitrary transformer layers. We introduce a lightweight fingerprinting mechanism for matching seman-tically similar inputs and propose adaptive eviction strategies to manage cache staleness. Experiments on BERT and GPT-2 across SQuAD, WikiText-103, and OpenBookQA show up to 3.1 X speedup in inference time with <0.5% accuracy degradation.

Code and data at https://algebra.baulab.info", "summary": "We investigate the mechanisms that arise when transformers are trained to solve arithmetic on sequences where tokens are variables whose meaning is determined only through their interactions. While prior work has found that transformers develop geometric embeddings that mirror algebraic structure, those previous findings emerge from settings where arithmetic-valued tokens have fixed meanings. We devise a new task in which the assignment of symbols to specific algebraic group elements varies from one sequence to another. Despite this challenging setup, transformers achieve near-perfect accuracy on the task and even generalize to unseen algebraic groups. We develop targeted data distributions to create causal tests of a set of hypothesized mechanisms, and we isolate three mechanisms models consistently learn: commutative copying where a dedicated head copies answers, identity element recognition that distinguishes identity-containing facts, and closure-based cancellation that tracks group membership to constrain valid answers. Complementary to the geometric representations found in fixed-symbol settings, our findings show that models develop symbolic reasoning mechanisms when trained to reason in-context with variables whose meanings are not fixed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u89e3\u51b3\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u53d8\u7b26\u53f7\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u7684\u7b97\u672f\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u6240\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u4ecd\u7136\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u7fa4\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b26\u53f7\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4ee3\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u5f53\u7b26\u53f7\u610f\u4e49\u4e0d\u662f\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\uff0c\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u5982\u4f55\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4ee3\u6570\u7fa4\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u914d\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u5230\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e0\u679c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e00\u7ec4\u5047\u8bbe\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4e00\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u590d\u5236\u3001\u6052\u7b49\u5143\u7d20\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u95ed\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u7684\u6d88\u9664\u3002", "result": "\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u5728\u8be5\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u7fa4\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u826f\u597d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u590d\u5236\u3001\u6052\u7b49\u5143\u7d20\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u95ed\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u7684\u6d88\u9664\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u53d8\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b26\u53f7\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Additionally, it has been shown that model performance improvement through fine-tuning often results from the strengthening of existing circuits in the model. Taken together, these findings suggest the possibility of intervening directly on such circuits to make precise, task-targeted updates. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method called Constructive Circuit Amplification which identifies pivotal tokens from model reasoning traces as well as model components responsible for the desired task, and updates only those components. Applied to mathematical reasoning, it improves accuracy by up to +11.4% across multiple models while modifying as little as 1.59% of model components, with minimal impact on other abilities as measured by MMLU, TriviaQA, and TruthfulQA. These results demonstrate that targeted capabilities can be reliably enhanced by selectively updating a sparse set of model components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aConstructive Circuit Amplification\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u4ed6\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u5230\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7535\u8def\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7535\u8def\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Constructive Circuit Amplification \u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5bf9\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u53ea\u66f4\u65b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9009\u5b9a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6539\u88c5\u5927\u91cf\u5176\u4ed6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe 11.4% \u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u53ea\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684 1.59%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u80fd\u529b\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5b9a\u529f\u80fd\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u4ed6\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training. Specifically, on AIME24, we improve DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0).

This paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer architectural framework that embeds societal values into AI systems as explicit constraints, safeguards, behavioural interfaces, auditing mechanisms, and governance processes. SRS models responsibility as a closed-loop supervisory control problem over socio-technical systems, integrating design-time safeguards with runtime monitoring and institutional oversight. We develop a unified constraint-based formulation, introduce safety-envelope and feedback interpretations, and show how fairness, autonomy, cognitive burden, and explanation quality can be continuously monitored and enforced. Case studies in clinical decision support, cooperative autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems illustrate how SRS translates normative objectives into actionable engineering and operational controls.

Experiments on RoboCasa Human-50, LIBERO, and real-world manipulation tasks show that GeoPredict consistently outperforms strong VLA baselines, especially in geometry-intensive and spatially demanding scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeoPredict \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684 VLA \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8f68\u8ff9\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u76843D\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u76843D\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684 VLA \u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u8981\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u76842D\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7cbe\u786e\u76843D\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u76843D\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "GeoPredict \u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f68\u8ff9\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u76843D\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u8f68\u8ff9\u6a21\u5757\u7f16\u7801\u8fd0\u52a8\u5386\u53f2\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u6b65\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u81c2\u76843D\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\u30023D\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u5757\u5219\u4f7f\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\u6307\u5f15\u8fdb\u884c\u672a\u6765\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5f3a\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u76843D\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5728 RoboCasa Human-50\uff0cLIBERO \u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cGeoPredict \u6bd4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684 VLA \u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "GeoPredict \u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 VLA \u6a21\u578b\u57283D\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Traditional models often employ random queries as anchors, optimizing them successively. Recent advancements complement or replace these random queries with detections from auxiliary networks. We propose a more intuitive and efficient approach by using BEV feature cells directly as anchors. This end-to-end approach leverages the dense grid of BEV queries, considering each cell as a potential object for the final detection task. As a result, we introduce a novel two-stage anchor generation method specifically designed for multi-camera 3D object detection. To address the scaling issues of attention with a large number of queries, we apply BEV-based Non-Maximum Suppression, allowing gradients to flow only through non-suppressed objects. This ensures efficient training without the need for post-processing. By using BEV features from encoders such as BEVFormer directly as object queries, temporal BEV information is inherently embedded. Building on the temporal BEV information already embedded in our object queries, we introduce a hybrid temporal modeling approach by integrating prior detections to further enhance detection performance. Evaluating our method on the nuScenes dataset shows consistent and significant improvements in NDS and mAP over the baseline, even with sparser BEV grids and therefore fewer initial anchors. It is particularly effective for small objects, enhancing pedestrian detection with a 3.8% mAP increase on nuScenes and an 8% increase in LET-mAP on Waymo. Applying our method, named DenseBEV, to the challenging Waymo Open dataset yields state-of-the-art performance, achieving a LET-mAP of 60.7%, surpassing the previous best by 5.4%.

However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems - such as Multimodal AI for Radiology Applications (MAIRA-2) and Medical Pathways Language Model-Multimodal (MedPaLM-M) - depend on large-scale multimodal training, clinical metadata, and multiple imaging views, making them resource-intensive and inaccessible for most settings. We introduce a compact image-to-text architecture that generates the Findings section of chest X-ray reports from a single frontal image. The model combines a frozen Self-Distillation with No Labels v3 (DINOv3) Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with a Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) decoder enhanced by layer-wise anatomical attention. This mechanism integrates lung and heart segmentation masks through hierarchical Gaussian smoothing, biasing attention toward clinically relevant regions without adding trainable parameters. Evaluated on the official Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR) dataset using Chest Radiograph Expert (CheXpert) and Radiology Graph (RadGraph) metrics, our approach achieved substantial gains: CheXpert Macro-F1 for five key pathologies increased by 168% (0.083 -> 0.238) and Micro-F1 by 146% (0.137 -> 0.337), while broader performance across 14 observations improved by 86% (0.170 -> 0.316). Structural coherence also improved, with RadGraph F1 rising by 9.7%. Despite its small size and purely image-conditioned design, the model demonstrates that decoder-level anatomical guidance improves spatial grounding and enhances coherence in clinically relevant regions.

We argue that satisfying these constraints can lead to benchmark drift over time, where the static benchmark judges fail to keep up with newer model capabilities. We show that benchmark drift is a significant problem for GenEval, one of the most popular T2I benchmarks. Although GenEval was well-aligned with human judgment at the time of its release, it has drifted far from human judgment over time -- resulting in an absolute error of as much as 17.7% for current models. This level of drift strongly suggests that GenEval has been saturated for some time, as we verify via a large-scale human study. To help fill this benchmarking gap, we introduce a new benchmark, GenEval 2, with improved coverage of primitive visual concepts and higher degrees of compositionality, which we show is more challenging for current models. We also introduce Soft-TIFA, an evaluation method for GenEval 2 that combines judgments for visual primitives, which we show is more well-aligned with human judgment and argue is less likely to drift from human-alignment over time (as compared to more holistic judges such as VQAScore). Although we hope GenEval 2 will provide a strong benchmark for many years, avoiding benchmark drift is far from guaranteed and our work, more generally, highlights the importance of continual audits and improvement for T2I and related automated model evaluation benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5Soft-TIFA\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684GenEval 2\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dText-to-Image\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u5224\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u8ddf\u4e0a\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6GenEval 2\u548c\u8f6fTIFA\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u590d\u5408\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u539f\u59cb\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "GenEval 2\u548cSoft-TIFA\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u5ba1\u8ba1\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9Text-to-Image\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u81ea\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u907f\u514d\u57fa\u51c6\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002"}}

Our project page: https://replan-iv-edit.github.io", "summary": "Instruction-based image editing enables natural-language control over visual modifications, yet existing models falter under Instruction-Visual Complexity (IV-Complexity), where intricate instructions meet cluttered or ambiguous scenes. We introduce RePlan (Region-aligned Planning), a plan-then-execute framework that couples a vision-language planner with a diffusion editor. The planner decomposes instructions via step-by-step reasoning and explicitly grounds them to target regions; the editor then applies changes using a training-free attention-region injection mechanism, enabling precise, parallel multi-region edits without iterative inpainting. To strengthen planning, we apply GRPO-based reinforcement learning using 1K instruction-only examples, yielding substantial gains in reasoning fidelity and format reliability.

However, training state-of-the-art models remains notoriously difficult, with current approaches often struggling to balance robustness against true imperceptibility. This work introduces Pixel Seal, which sets a new state-of-the-art for image and video watermarking. We first identify three fundamental issues of existing methods: (i) the reliance on proxy perceptual losses such as MSE and LPIPS that fail to mimic human perception and result in visible watermark artifacts; (ii) the optimization instability caused by conflicting objectives, which necessitates exhaustive hyperparameter tuning; and (iii) reduced robustness and imperceptibility of watermarks when scaling models to high-resolution images and videos. To overcome these issues, we first propose an adversarial-only training paradigm that eliminates unreliable pixel-wise imperceptibility losses. Second, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that stabilizes convergence by decoupling robustness and imperceptibility. Third, we address the resolution gap via high-resolution adaptation, employing JND-based attenuation and training-time inference simulation to eliminate upscaling artifacts. We thoroughly evaluate the robustness and imperceptibility of Pixel Seal on different image types and across a wide range of transformations, and show clear improvements over the state-of-the-art. We finally demonstrate that the model efficiently adapts to video via temporal watermark pooling, positioning Pixel Seal as a practical and scalable solution for reliable provenance in real-world image and video settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPixel Seal\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u663e\u8457\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u3002Pixel Seal\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6c34\u5370\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u6781\u5927\u5730\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6c34\u5370\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u9047\u5230\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6280\u672fPixel Seal\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "Pixel Seal\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\u3002\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d88\u9664\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9002\u5e94\u5219\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8eJND\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u62df\u6765\u53bb\u9664\u653e\u5927\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cPixel Seal\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u50cf\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u660e\u663e\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u8fd8\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Pixel Seal\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6c34\u5370\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u5b57\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u6765\u6e90\u3002"}}

While SAM3 provides a powerful spatio-temporal framework for video object segmentation, its performance in surgical scenes is limited by indiscriminate memory updates, fixed memory capacity, and weak identity recovery after occlusions. We propose ReMeDI-SAM3, a training-free memory-enhanced extension of SAM3, that addresses these limitations through three components: (i) relevance-aware memory filtering with a dedicated occlusion-aware memory for storing pre-occlusion frames, (ii) a piecewise interpolation scheme that expands the effective memory capacity, and (iii) a feature-based re-identification module with temporal voting for reliable post-occlusion identity disambiguation. Together, these components mitigate error accumulation and enable reliable recovery after occlusions. Evaluations on EndoVis17 and EndoVis18 under a zero-shot setting show absolute mcIoU improvements of around 7% and 16%, respectively, over vanilla SAM3, outperforming even prior training-based approaches.

Existing methods for estimating such physical material parameters from visual data assume homogeneous single-material objects, pre-learned dynamics, or simplistic topologies. Real-world objects, however, are often complex in material composition and geometry lying outside the realm of these assumptions. In this paper, we particularly focus on flowers as a representative common object. We introduce Multi-material Physical Gaussians (M-PhyGs) to estimate the material composition and parameters of such multi-material complex natural objects from video. From a short video captured in a natural setting, M-PhyGs jointly segments the object into similar materials and recovers their continuum mechanical parameters while accounting for gravity.

However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks.

This paper presents FlashPortrait, an end-to-end video diffusion transformer capable of synthesizing ID-preserving, infinite-length videos while achieving up to 6x acceleration in inference speed. In particular, FlashPortrait begins by computing the identity-agnostic facial expression features with an off-the-shelf extractor. It then introduces a Normalized Facial Expression Block to align facial features with diffusion latents by normalizing them with their respective means and variances, thereby improving identity stability in facial modeling. During inference, FlashPortrait adopts a dynamic sliding-window scheme with weighted blending in overlapping areas, ensuring smooth transitions and ID consistency in long animations. In each context window, based on the latent variation rate at particular timesteps and the derivative magnitude ratio among diffusion layers, FlashPortrait utilizes higher-order latent derivatives at the current timestep to directly predict latents at future timesteps, thereby skipping several denoising steps and achieving 6x speed acceleration. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of FlashPortrait both qualitatively and quantitatively.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlashPortrait \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u65e0\u9650\u957f\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u81f3\u539f\u6765\u76846\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u52a0\u901f\u957f\u753b\u5e45\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0cFlashPortrait \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "FlashPortrait \u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u8eab\u4efd\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u9762\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8eab\u4efd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u52a0\u6743\u6df7\u5408\u786e\u4fdd\u957f\u52a8\u753b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8df3\u8fc7\u8bb8\u591a\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b06\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "result": "FlashPortrait \u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0a\u90fd\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FlashPortrait \u7684\u63d0\u51fa\u4e3a\u957f\u7ed8\u753b\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of training data. Web-crawled and synthetic image datasets often contain low-quality or redundant samples, which lead to degraded visual fidelity, unstable training, and inefficient computation. Hence, effective data selection is crucial for improving data efficiency. Existing approaches rely on costly manual curation or heuristic scoring based on single-dimensional features in Text-to-Image data filtering. Although meta-learning based method has been explored in LLM, there is no adaptation for image modalities. To this end, we propose **Alchemist**, a meta-gradient-based framework to select a suitable subset from large-scale text-image data pairs. Our approach automatically learns to assess the influence of each sample by iteratively optimizing the model from a data-centric perspective. Alchemist consists of two key stages: data rating and data pruning. We train a lightweight rater to estimate each sample's influence based on gradient information, enhanced with multi-granularity perception. We then use the Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets for efficient model training.

However, existing diffusion-based approaches are often trained on paired data of simple editing operations, which fundamentally limits their ability to generalize to diverse and complex, real-world instructions. To address this generalization gap, we propose VIVA, a scalable framework for instruction-based video editing that leverages VLM-guided encoding and reward optimization. First, we introduce a VLM-based instructor that encodes the textual instruction, the first frame of the source video, and an optional reference image into visually-grounded instruction representations, providing fine-grained spatial and semantic context for the diffusion transformer backbone. Second, we propose a post-training stage, Edit-GRPO, which adapts Group Relative Policy Optimization to the domain of video editing, directly optimizing the model for instruction-faithful, content-preserving, and aesthetically pleasing edits using relative rewards. Furthermore, we propose a data construction pipeline designed to synthetically generate diverse, high-fidelity paired video-instruction data of basic editing operations. Extensive experiments show that VIVA achieves superior instruction following, generalization, and editing quality over state-of-the-art methods.

Detecting such changes is important for many applications, such as robotic tidying or construction progress and safety monitoring. A major challenge is that varying viewpoints can cause objects to falsely appear changed. We introduce SceneDiff Benchmark, the first multiview change detection benchmark with object instance annotations, comprising 350 diverse video pairs with thousands of changed objects. We also introduce the SceneDiff method, a new training-free approach for multiview object change detection that leverages pretrained 3D, segmentation, and image encoding models to robustly predict across multiple benchmarks.

We study the design space of data, architecture, and control, and introduce \\emph{EasyV2V}, a simple and effective framework for instruction-based video editing. On the data side, we compose existing experts with fast inverses to build diverse video pairs, lift image edit pairs into videos via single-frame supervision and pseudo pairs with shared affine motion, mine dense-captioned clips for video pairs, and add transition supervision to teach how edits unfold. On the model side, we observe that pretrained text-to-video models possess editing capability, motivating a simplified design. Simple sequence concatenation for conditioning with light LoRA fine-tuning suffices to train a strong model. For control, we unify spatiotemporal control via a single mask mechanism and support optional reference images. Overall, EasyV2V works with flexible inputs, e.g., video+text, video+mask+text, video+mask+reference+text, and achieves state-of-the-art video editing results, surpassing concurrent and commercial systems.

Project page:https://hybridrobotics.github.io/MomaGraph/", "summary": "Mobile manipulators in households must both navigate and manipulate. This requires a compact, semantically rich scene representation that captures where objects are, how they function, and which parts are actionable. Scene graphs are a natural choice, yet prior work often separates spatial and functional relations, treats scenes as static snapshots without object states or temporal updates, and overlooks information most relevant for accomplishing the current task. To address these limitations, we introduce MomaGraph, a unified scene representation for embodied agents that integrates spatial-functional relationships and part-level interactive elements. However, advancing such a representation requires both suitable data and rigorous evaluation, which have been largely missing. We thus contribute MomaGraph-Scenes, the first large-scale dataset of richly annotated, task-driven scene graphs in household environments, along with MomaGraph-Bench, a systematic evaluation suite spanning six reasoning capabilities from high-level planning to fine-grained scene understanding. Built upon this foundation, we further develop MomaGraph-R1, a 7B vision-language model trained with reinforcement learning on MomaGraph-Scenes. MomaGraph-R1 predicts task-oriented scene graphs and serves as a zero-shot task planner under a Graph-then-Plan framework.

To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence. AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models. Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16 benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart.

However, producing 3D videos remains costly and complex, while automatic Monocular-to-Stereo conversion is hindered by the limitations of the multi-stage ``Depth-Warp-Inpaint'' (DWI) pipeline. This paradigm suffers from error propagation, depth ambiguity, and format inconsistency between parallel and converged stereo configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce UniStereo, the first large-scale unified dataset for stereo video conversion, covering both stereo formats to enable fair benchmarking and robust model training. Building upon this dataset, we propose StereoPilot, an efficient feed-forward model that directly synthesizes the target view without relying on explicit depth maps or iterative diffusion sampling. Equipped with a learnable domain switcher and a cycle consistency loss, StereoPilot adapts seamlessly to different stereo formats and achieves improved consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StereoPilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and computational efficiency.

However, existing open-source models often exhibit blind tool-use reasoning patterns, invoking vision tools even when they are unnecessary, which significantly increases inference overhead and degrades model performance. To this end, we propose AdaTooler-V, an MLLM that performs adaptive tool-use by determining whether a visual problem truly requires tools. First, we introduce AT-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts reward scales based on the Tool Benefit Score of each sample, encouraging the model to invoke tools only when they provide genuine improvements. Moreover, we construct two datasets to support training: AdaTooler-V-CoT-100k for SFT cold start and AdaTooler-V-300k for RL with verifiable rewards across single-image, multi-image, and video data. Experiments across twelve benchmarks demonstrate the strong reasoning capability of AdaTooler-V, outperforming existing methods in diverse visual reasoning tasks. Notably, AdaTooler-V-7B achieves an accuracy of 89.8\\% on the high-resolution benchmark V*, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro.

Unlike text-only approaches and existing trajectory-controlled image-to-video methods, our multimodal approach combines trajectories -- encoding motion, timing, and visibility -- with natural language for semantic intent and reference images for visual grounding of object identity, enabling the generation of coherent, controllable events that include multi-agent interactions, object entry/exit, reference-guided appearance and counterintuitive events. The resulting videos demonstrate not only temporal coherence but also emergent consistency, preserving object identity and scene despite temporary disappearance. By supporting expressive world events generation, WorldCanvas advances world models from passive predictors to interactive, user-shaped simulators.
