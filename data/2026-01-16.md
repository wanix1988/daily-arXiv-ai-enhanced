TL;DR: LCF3D是一种新颖的传感器融合框架，它结合了RGB图像上的2D对象检测和LiDAR点云上的3D对象检测，通过晚融合方法减少LiDAR的误报，并通过级联融合方法从LiDAR中恢复未检测到的对象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，准确地检测3D物体（如行人、自行车和其他车辆）至关重要。为了提高检测性能，自动驾驶车辆结合使用RGB相机和LiDAR传感器，但这些数据源的有效融合对于3D物体检测仍然具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 结论是在自动驾驶中，LCF3D框架展示了提高3D物体检测性能的潜力，特别是在处理具有挑战性的物体类别时。

Abstract: Accurately localizing 3D objects like pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles is essential in Autonomous Driving. To ensure high detection performance, Autonomous Vehicles complement RGB cameras with LiDAR sensors, but effectively combining these data sources for 3D object detection remains challenging. We propose LCF3D, a novel sensor fusion framework that combines a 2D object detector on RGB images with a 3D object detector on LiDAR point clouds. By leveraging multimodal fusion principles, we compensate for inaccuracies in the LiDAR object detection network. Our solution combines two key principles: (i) late fusion, to reduce LiDAR False Positives by matching LiDAR 3D detections with RGB 2D detections and filtering out unmatched LiDAR detections; and (ii) cascade fusion, to recover missed objects from LiDAR by generating new 3D frustum proposals corresponding to unmatched RGB detections. Experiments show that LCF3D is beneficial for domain generalization, as it turns out to be successful in handling different sensor configurations between training and testing domains. LCF3D achieves significant improvements over LiDAR-based methods, particularly for challenging categories like pedestrians and cyclists in the KITTI dataset, as well as motorcycles and bicycles in nuScenes.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 offer strong generative priors that are highly valuable for image restoration, yet their full pipelines remain too computationally heavy for deployment on edge devices. Existing lightweight variants predominantly compress the denoising U-Net or reduce the diffusion trajectory, which disrupts the underlying latent manifold and limits generalization beyond a single task. We introduce NanoSD, a family of Pareto-optimal diffusion foundation models distilled from Stable Diffusion 1.5 through network surgery, feature-wise generative distillation, and structured architectural scaling jointly applied to the U-Net and the VAE encoder-decoder. This full-pipeline co-design preserves the generative prior while producing models that occupy distinct operating points along the accuracy-latency-size frontier (e.g., 130M-315M parameters, achieving real-time inference down to 20ms on mobile-class NPUs). We show that parameter reduction alone does not correlate with hardware efficiency, and we provide an analysis revealing how architectural balance, feature routing, and latent-space preservation jointly shape true on-device latency. When used as a drop-in backbone, NanoSD enables state-of-the-art performance across image super-resolution, image deblurring, face restoration, and monocular depth estimation, outperforming prior lightweight diffusion models in both perceptual quality and practical deployability. NanoSD establishes a general-purpose diffusion foundation model family suitable for real-time visual generation and restoration on edge devices.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multimodal video captioning condenses dense footage into a structured format of keyframes and natural language. By creating a cohesive multimodal summary, this approach anchors generative AI in rich semantic evidence and serves as a lightweight proxy for high-efficiency retrieval. However, traditional metrics like BLEU or ROUGE fail to quantify information coverage across disparate modalities, such as comparing a paragraph of text to a sequence of keyframes. To address this, we propose the Video Summary Information Loss (ViSIL) score, an information-theoretic framework that quantifies the video information not captured by a summary via vision-language model (VLM) inference. By measuring the information loss, ViSIL is a unified metric that enables direct comparison across multimodal summary formats despite their structural discrepancies. Our results demonstrate that ViSIL scores show a statistically significant correlation with both human and VLM performance on Video Question Answering (VQA) tasks. ViSIL also enables summary selection to optimize the trade-off between information loss and processing speed, establishing a Pareto-optimal frontier that outperforms text summaries by $7\%$ in VQA accuracy without increasing processing load.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: CLIP has become a cornerstone of multimodal representation learning, yet improving its performance typically requires a prohibitively costly process of training from scratch on billions of samples. We ask a different question: Can we improve the performance of open-weight CLIP models across various downstream tasks using only existing self-supervised datasets? Unlike supervised fine-tuning, which adapts a pretrained model to a single downstream task, our setting seeks to improve general performance across various tasks. However, as both our experiments and prior studies reveal, simply applying standard training protocols starting from an open-weight CLIP model often fails, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce TuneCLIP, a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that overcomes the performance degradation. TuneCLIP has two key components: (1) a warm-up stage of recovering optimization statistics to reduce cold-start bias, inspired by theoretical analysis, and (2) a fine-tuning stage of optimizing a new contrastive loss to mitigate the penalization on false negative pairs. Our extensive experiments show that TuneCLIP consistently improves performance across model architectures and scales. Notably, it elevates leading open-weight models like SigLIP (ViT-B/16), achieving gains of up to +2.5% on ImageNet and related out-of-distribution benchmarks, and +1.2% on the highly competitive DataComp benchmark, setting a new strong baseline for efficient post-pretraining adaptation.

TL;DR: VibrantSR是一种基于生成的超分辨率框架，可以从10米分辨率的Sentinel-2影像中估计0.5米的林冠高度模型（CHMs），在22个美国西部的EPA Level 3生态区域的测试中，其均绝对误差（MAE）为4.39米，优于其他基准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于基于航空影像的方法受制于定期且不规则的获取安排，VibrantSR利用全球可用的Sentinel-2季节性合成影像，提供了一种成本较低且覆盖范围更广的林冠高度监测解决方案。

Method: VibrantSR采用了一种生成式超分辨率框架，可以从较低分辨率的影像中生成高分辨率的林冠高度模型。

Result: 在22个EPA Level 3生态区域的评估中，VibrantSR的表现优于Meta、LANDFIRE和ETH等卫星基准方法，特别是对于至少2米高的林冠高度，其均绝对误差为4.39米。

Conclusion: VibrantSR能够在非依赖于成本高昂和时间稀缺的航空影像收购下，实现对森林监测和碳核算的大规模操作。

Abstract: We present VibrantSR (Vibrant Super-Resolution), a generative super-resolution framework for estimating 0.5 meter canopy height models (CHMs) from 10 meter Sentinel-2 imagery. Unlike approaches based on aerial imagery that are constrained by infrequent and irregular acquisition schedules, VibrantSR leverages globally available Sentinel-2 seasonal composites, enabling consistent monitoring at a seasonal-to-annual cadence. Evaluated across 22 EPA Level 3 eco-regions in the western United States using spatially disjoint validation splits, VibrantSR achieves a Mean Absolute Error of 4.39 meters for canopy heights >= 2 m, outperforming Meta (4.83 m), LANDFIRE (5.96 m), and ETH (7.05 m) satellite-based benchmarks. While aerial-based VibrantVS (2.71 m MAE) retains an accuracy advantage, VibrantSR enables operational forest monitoring and carbon accounting at continental scales without reliance on costly and temporally infrequent aerial acquisitions.

Abstract: Recent progress in medical vision-language models (VLMs) has achieved strong performance on image-level text-centric tasks such as report generation and visual question answering (VQA). However, achieving fine-grained visual grounding and volumetric spatial reasoning in 3D medical VLMs remains challenging, particularly when aiming to unify these capabilities within a single, generalizable framework. To address this challenge, we proposed MedVL-SAM2, a unified 3D medical multimodal model that concurrently supports report generation, VQA, and multi-paradigm segmentation, including semantic, referring, and interactive segmentation. MedVL-SAM2 integrates image-level reasoning and pixel-level perception through a cohesive architecture tailored for 3D medical imaging, and incorporates a SAM2-based volumetric segmentation module to enable precise multi-granular spatial reasoning. The model is trained in a multi-stage pipeline: it is first pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of 3D CT image-text pairs to align volumetric visual features with radiology-language embeddings. It is then jointly optimized with both language-understanding and segmentation objectives using a comprehensive 3D CT segmentation dataset. This joint training enables flexible interaction via language, point, or box prompts, thereby unifying high-level visual reasoning with spatially precise localization. Our unified architecture delivers state-of-the-art performance across report generation, VQA, and multiple 3D segmentation tasks. Extensive analyses further show that the model provides reliable 3D visual grounding, controllable interactive segmentation, and robust cross-modal reasoning, demonstrating that high-level semantic reasoning and precise 3D localization can be jointly achieved within a unified 3D medical VLM.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OT-Drive的优化传输驱动多模态融合框架，通过将RGB和表面法线融合问题转化为分布传输问题，并通过设计场景锚点生成器和优化传输多模态融合模块，实现了在未见过的场景下鲁棒的可穿越区域分割。

Conclusion: 该模型通过少量训练数据实现强大的OOD泛化能力，增强了其实用性和部署效率。

Abstract: Reliable traversable area segmentation in unstructured environments is critical for planning and decision-making in autonomous driving. However, existing data-driven approaches often suffer from degraded segmentation performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, consequently impairing downstream driving tasks. To address this issue, we propose OT-Drive, an Optimal Transport--driven multi-modal fusion framework. The proposed method formulates RGB and surface normal fusion as a distribution transport problem. Specifically, we design a novel Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) to decompose scene information into the joint distribution of weather, time-of-day, and road type, thereby constructing semantic anchors that can generalize to unseen scenarios. Subsequently, we design an innovative Optimal Transport-based multi-modal fusion module (OT Fusion) to transport RGB and surface normal features onto the manifold defined by the semantic anchors, enabling robust traversable area segmentation under OOD scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 95.16% mIoU on ORFD OOD scenarios, outperforming prior methods by 6.35%, and 89.79% mIoU on cross-dataset transfer tasks, surpassing baselines by 13.99%.These results indicate that the proposed model can attain strong OOD generalization with only limited training data, substantially enhancing its practicality and efficiency for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, but their ability to capture spatial relationships remains a blindspot. Current VLMs are typically built with contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) style image encoders. The training recipe often flattens images into 1D patch sequences, discarding the 2D structure necessary for spatial reasoning. We argue that this lack of spatial awareness is a missing dimension in VLM design and a bottleneck for applications requiring spatial grounding, such as robotics and embodied AI. To address this, we investigate (i) image encoders trained with alternative objectives and (ii) 2D positional encodings. Our experiments show that these architectural choices can lead to improved spatial reasoning on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reasoning segmentation is an emerging vision-language task that requires reasoning over intricate text queries to precisely segment objects. However, existing methods typically suffer from overthinking, generating verbose reasoning chains that interfere with object localization in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this issue, we propose DR$^2$Seg, a self-rewarding framework that improves both reasoning efficiency and segmentation accuracy without requiring extra thinking supervision. DR$^2$Seg employs a two-stage rollout strategy that decomposes reasoning segmentation into multimodal reasoning and referring segmentation. In the first stage, the model generates a self-contained description that explicitly specifies the target object. In the second stage, this description replaces the original complex query to verify its self-containment. Based on this design, two self-rewards are introduced to strengthen goal-oriented reasoning and suppress redundant thinking. Extensive experiments across MLLMs of varying scales and segmentation models demonstrate that DR$^2$Seg consistently improves reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究介绍了用于评估Video Event Relation Hallucination的新基准VERHallu，包括因果、时间及子事件关系分类和回答问题的任务。研究发现当前最先进的VideoLLMs在处理密集事件关系时依赖先验知识而非帧级线索，因此提出了一种Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) 战略，通过在中间层重新分配帧级注意来增强多事件理解，实验表明该策略能有效降低事件关系幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视频大语言模型（VideoLLMs）在处理事件关系时存在幻觉问题，特别是在密集事件关系推理方面表现不佳。这是因为模型过度依赖于先验知识，而非有效的帧级线索。研究者为了更好地评估和改进这一能力，引入了VERHallu基准，以期指导未来的模型设计。

Method: 研究者设计了VERHallu基准，涉及关系分类、问答及反事实问答三种任务。此外，基准还包含了一些违反直觉的视频场景，旨在测试模型对非典型情况的处理能力。针对模型能力的不足，研究者提出了一种Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) 战略，通过在中间层重新分配帧级注意力，增强对多事件的理解。

Result: VERHallu基准能够帮助研究者全面评估视频事件关系的幻觉现象。研究者将现有的最新模型应用在VERHallu基准上，并通过KFP策略改进了模型的表现。实验结果表明，KFP策略能够有效地缓解事件关系幻觉现象，而不会显著影响推理速度。

Conclusion: 研究引入了新的基准VERHallu，旨在更加全面地评估和测试视频事件关系处理能力，并提出了一种改进策略KFP。该研究强调了帧级线索在处理视频事件关系中的重要性，为未来的模型设计提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) exhibit various types of hallucinations. Existing research has primarily focused on hallucinations involving the presence of events, objects, and scenes in videos, while largely neglecting event relation hallucination. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating the Video Event Relation Hallucination, named VERHallu. This benchmark focuses on causal, temporal, and subevent relations between events, encompassing three types of tasks: relation classification, question answering, and counterfactual question answering, for a comprehensive evaluation of event relation hallucination. Additionally, it features counterintuitive video scenarios that deviate from typical pretraining distributions, with each sample accompanied by human-annotated candidates covering both vision-language and pure language biases. Our analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art VideoLLMs struggle with dense-event relation reasoning, often relying on prior knowledge due to insufficient use of frame-level cues. Although these models demonstrate strong grounding capabilities for key events, they often overlook the surrounding subevents, leading to an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of event relations. To tackle this, we propose a Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) strategy, which reallocates frame-level attention within intermediate layers to enhance multi-event understanding. Experiments show it effectively mitigates the event relation hallucination without affecting inference speed.

Abstract: Text-to-image person re-identification (TIReID) aims to retrieve person images from a large gallery given free-form textual descriptions. TIReID is challenging due to the substantial modality gap between visual appearances and textual expressions, as well as the need to model fine-grained correspondences that distinguish individuals with similar attributes such as clothing color, texture, or outfit style. To address these issues, we propose DiCo (Disentangled Concept Representation), a novel framework that achieves hierarchical and disentangled cross-modal alignment. DiCo introduces a shared slot-based representation, where each slot acts as a part-level anchor across modalities and is further decomposed into multiple concept blocks. This design enables the disentanglement of complementary attributes (\textit{e.g.}, color, texture, shape) while maintaining consistent part-level correspondence between image and text. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods, while also enhancing interpretability through explicit slot- and block-level representations for more fine-grained retrieval results.

Abstract: Underwater imaging is fundamentally challenging due to wavelength-dependent light attenuation, strong scattering from suspended particles, turbidity-induced blur, and non-uniform illumination. These effects impair standard cameras and make ground-truth motion nearly impossible to obtain. On the other hand, event cameras offer microsecond resolution and high dynamic range. Nonetheless, progress on investigating event cameras for underwater environments has been limited due to the lack of datasets that pair realistic underwater optics with accurate optical flow. To address this problem, we introduce the first synthetic underwater benchmark dataset for event-based optical flow derived from physically-based ray-traced RGBD sequences. Using a modern video-to-event pipeline applied to rendered underwater videos, we produce realistic event data streams with dense ground-truth flow, depth, and camera motion. Moreover, we benchmark state-of-the-art learning-based and model-based optical flow prediction methods to understand how underwater light transport affects event formation and motion estimation accuracy. Our dataset establishes a new baseline for future development and evaluation of underwater event-based perception algorithms. The source code and dataset for this project are publicly available at https://robotic-vision-lab.github.io/ueof.

Abstract: Recent video generation models have revealed the emergence of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning, enabling frame-by-frame visual inference. With this capability, video models have been successfully applied to various visual tasks (e.g., maze solving, visual puzzles). However, their potential to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation remains largely unexplored due to the absence of a clearly defined visual reasoning starting point and interpretable intermediate states in the T2I generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose CoF-T2I, a model that integrates CoF reasoning into T2I generation via progressive visual refinement, where intermediate frames act as explicit reasoning steps and the final frame is taken as output. To establish such an explicit generation process, we curate CoF-Evol-Instruct, a dataset of CoF trajectories that model the generation process from semantics to aesthetics. To further improve quality and avoid motion artifacts, we enable independent encoding operation for each frame. Experiments show that CoF-T2I significantly outperforms the base video model and achieves competitive performance on challenging benchmarks, reaching 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench. These results indicate the substantial promise of video models for advancing high-quality text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce ReaMIL (Reasoning- and Evidence-Aware MIL), a multiple instance learning approach for whole-slide histopathology that adds a light selection head to a strong MIL backbone. The head produces soft per-tile gates and is trained with a budgeted-sufficiency objective: a hinge loss that enforces the true-class probability to be $\geq τ$ using only the kept evidence, under a sparsity budget on the number of selected tiles. The budgeted-sufficiency objective yields small, spatially compact evidence sets without sacrificing baseline performance. Across TCGA-NSCLC (LUAD vs. LUSC), TCGA-BRCA (IDC vs. Others), and PANDA, ReaMIL matches or slightly improves baseline AUC and provides quantitative evidence-efficiency diagnostics. On NSCLC, it attains AUC 0.983 with a mean minimal sufficient K (MSK) $\approx 8.2$ tiles at $τ= 0.90$ and AUKC $\approx 0.864$, showing that class confidence rises sharply and stabilizes once a small set of tiles is kept. The method requires no extra supervision, integrates seamlessly with standard MIL training, and naturally yields slide-level overlays. We report accuracy alongside MSK, AUKC, and contiguity for rigorous evaluation of model behavior on WSIs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In 1888, Vincent van Gogh wrote, "I am seeking exaggeration in the essential." This principle, amplifying structural form while suppressing photographic detail, lies at the core of Post-Impressionist art. However, most existing 3D style transfer methods invert this philosophy, treating geometry as a rigid substrate for surface-level texture projection. To authentically reproduce Post-Impressionist stylization, geometric abstraction must be embraced as the primary vehicle of expression.
  We propose a flow-guided geometric advection framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operationalizes this principle in a mesh-free setting. Our method extracts directional flow fields from 2D paintings and back-propagates them into 3D space, rectifying Gaussian primitives to form flow-aligned brushstrokes that conform to scene topology without relying on explicit mesh priors. This enables expressive structural deformation driven directly by painterly motion rather than photometric constraints.
  Our contributions are threefold: (1) a projection-based, mesh-free flow guidance mechanism that transfers 2D artistic motion into 3D Gaussian geometry; (2) a luminance-structure decoupling strategy that isolates geometric deformation from color optimization, mitigating artifacts during aggressive structural abstraction; and (3) a VLM-as-a-Judge evaluation framework that assesses artistic authenticity through aesthetic judgment instead of conventional pixel-level metrics, explicitly addressing the subjective nature of artistic stylization.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose difficulty-guided sampling (DGS) to bridge the target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task, therefore improving the performance of dataset distillation. Deep neural networks achieve remarkable performance but have time and storage-consuming training processes. Dataset distillation is proposed to generate compact, high-quality distilled datasets, enabling effective model training while maintaining downstream performance. Existing approaches typically focus on features extracted from the original dataset, overlooking task-specific information, which leads to a target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task. We propose leveraging characteristics that benefit the downstream training into data distillation to bridge this gap. Focusing on the downstream task of image classification, we introduce the concept of difficulty and propose DGS as a plug-in post-stage sampling module. Following the specific target difficulty distribution, the final distilled dataset is sampled from image pools generated by existing methods. We also propose difficulty-aware guidance (DAG) to explore the effect of difficulty in the generation process. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. It also highlights the broader potential of difficulty for diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal learning have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, state-of-the-art approaches rely heavily on large-scale human-annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we introduce V-Zero, a general post-training framework that facilitates self-improvement using exclusively unlabeled images. V-Zero establishes a co-evolutionary loop by instantiating two distinct roles: a Questioner and a Solver. The Questioner learns to synthesize high-quality, challenging questions by leveraging a dual-track reasoning reward that contrasts intuitive guesses with reasoned results. The Solver is optimized using pseudo-labels derived from majority voting over its own sampled responses. Both roles are trained iteratively via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), driving a cycle of mutual enhancement. Remarkably, without a single human annotation, V-Zero achieves consistent performance gains on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, improving visual mathematical reasoning by +1.7 and general vision-centric by +2.6, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement in multimodal systems.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify instances from both known and novel categories within a large-scale unlabeled dataset, a critical yet challenging task for real-world, open-world applications. However, existing methods often rely on pseudo-labeling, or two-stage clustering, which lack a principled mechanism to explicitly disentangle essential, category-defining signals from instance-specific noise. In this paper, we address this fundamental limitation by re-framing GCD from an information-theoretic perspective, grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. We introduce InfoSculpt, a novel framework that systematically sculpts the representation space by minimizing a dual Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) objective. InfoSculpt uniquely combines a Category-Level CMI on labeled data to learn compact and discriminative representations for known classes, and a complementary Instance-Level CMI on all data to distill invariant features by compressing augmentation-induced noise. These two objectives work synergistically at different scales to produce a disentangled and robust latent space where categorical information is preserved while noisy, instance-specific details are discarded. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that InfoSculpt validating the effectiveness of our information-theoretic approach.

Abstract: Interactive humanoid video generation aims to synthesize lifelike visual agents that can engage with humans through continuous and responsive video. Despite recent advances in video synthesis, existing methods often grapple with the trade-off between high-fidelity synthesis and real-time interaction requirements. In this paper, we propose FlowAct-R1, a framework specifically designed for real-time interactive humanoid video generation. Built upon a MMDiT architecture, FlowAct-R1 enables the streaming synthesis of video with arbitrary durations while maintaining low-latency responsiveness. We introduce a chunkwise diffusion forcing strategy, complemented by a novel self-forcing variant, to alleviate error accumulation and ensure long-term temporal consistency during continuous interaction. By leveraging efficient distillation and system-level optimizations, our framework achieves a stable 25fps at 480p resolution with a time-to-first-frame (TTFF) of only around 1.5 seconds. The proposed method provides holistic and fine-grained full-body control, enabling the agent to transition naturally between diverse behavioral states in interactive scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowAct-R1 achieves exceptional behavioral vividness and perceptual realism, while maintaining robust generalization across diverse character styles.

Abstract: The automated extraction of structured questions from paper-based mathematics exams is fundamental to intelligent education, yet remains challenging in real-world settings due to severe visual noise. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on clean documents or generic layout analysis, overlooking both the structural integrity of mathematical problems and the ability of models to actively reject incomplete inputs. We introduce MathDoc, the first benchmark for document-level information extraction from authentic high school mathematics exam papers. MathDoc contains \textbf{3,609} carefully curated questions with real-world artifacts and explicitly includes unrecognizable samples to evaluate active refusal behavior. We propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework covering stem accuracy, visual similarity, and refusal capability. Experiments on SOTA MLLMs, including Qwen3-VL and Gemini-2.5-Pro, show that although end-to-end models achieve strong extraction performance, they consistently fail to refuse illegible inputs, instead producing confident but invalid outputs. These results highlight a critical gap in current MLLMs and establish MathDoc as a benchmark for assessing model reliability under degraded document conditions.

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm, enabling models to perform novel visual tasks by learning from in-context examples. The dominant "retrieve-then-prompt" approach typically relies on selecting the single best visual prompt, a practice that often discards valuable contextual information from other suitable candidates. While recent work has explored fusing the top-K prompts into a single, enhanced representation, this still simply collapses multiple rich signals into one, limiting the model's reasoning capability. We argue that a more multi-faceted, collaborative fusion is required to unlock the full potential of these diverse contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework that moves beyond single-prompt fusion towards an multi-combination collaborative fusion. Instead of collapsing multiple prompts into one, our method generates three contextual representation branches, each formed by integrating information from different combinations of top-quality prompts. These complementary guidance signals are then fed into proposed MULTI-VQGAN architecture, which is designed to jointly interpret and utilize collaborative information from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization, highlight its strong cross-task generalization, effective contextual fusion, and ability to produce more robust and accurate predictions than existing methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vision In-Context Learning (VICL) enables inpainting models to quickly adapt to new visual tasks from only a few prompts. However, existing methods suffer from two key issues: (1) selecting only the most similar prompt discards complementary cues from other high-quality prompts; and (2) failing to exploit the structured information implied by different prompt arrangements.
  We propose an end-to-end VICL framework to overcome these limitations. Firstly, an adaptive Fusion Module aggregates critical patterns and annotations from multiple prompts to form more precise contextual prompts. Secondly, we introduce arrangement-specific lightweight MLPs to decouple layout priors from the core model, while minimally affecting the overall model. In addition, an bidirectional fine-tuning mechanism swaps the roles of query and prompt, encouraging the model to reconstruct the original prompt from fused context and thus enhancing collaboration between the fusion module and the inpainting model. Experiments on foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization demonstrate superior results and strong cross-task generalization of our method.

Abstract: Consistency learning with feature perturbation is a widely used strategy in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. However, many existing perturbation methods rely on dropout, and thus require a careful manual tuning of the dropout rate, which is a sensitive hyperparameter and often difficult to optimize and may lead to suboptimal regularization. To overcome this limitation, we propose VQ-Seg, the first approach to employ vector quantization (VQ) to discretize the feature space and introduce a novel and controllable Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) that replaces dropout. Our QPM perturbs discrete representations by shuffling the spatial locations of codebook indices, enabling effective and controllable regularization. To mitigate potential information loss caused by quantization, we design a dual-branch architecture where the post-quantization feature space is shared by both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Moreover, we introduce a Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA) to incorporate guidance from a foundation model (FM), supplementing the high-level semantic information lost during quantization. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale Lung Cancer (LC) dataset comprising 828 CT scans annotated for central-type lung carcinoma. Extensive experiments on the LC dataset and other public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Current multimodal latent reasoning often relies on external supervision (e.g., auxiliary images), ignoring intrinsic visual attention dynamics. In this work, we identify a critical Perception Gap in distillation: student models frequently mimic a teacher's textual output while attending to fundamentally divergent visual regions, effectively relying on language priors rather than grounded perception. To bridge this, we propose LaViT, a framework that aligns latent visual thoughts rather than static embeddings. LaViT compels the student to autoregressively reconstruct the teacher's visual semantics and attention trajectories prior to text generation, employing a curriculum sensory gating mechanism to prevent shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show that LaViT significantly enhances visual grounding, achieving up to +16.9% gains on complex reasoning tasks and enabling a compact 3B model to outperform larger open-source variants and proprietary models like GPT-4o.

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has highlighted their potential for performing complex video understanding tasks. However, in the domain of Video Anomaly Detection and Understanding (VAD&U), existing MLLM-based methods are largely limited to anomaly localization or post-hoc description, lacking explicit reasoning processes, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation. To address this gap, we define a new task termed Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which elevates video anomaly analysis from descriptive understanding to structured, multi-stage reasoning. VAR explicitly requires models to perform progressive reasoning over anomalous events before answering anomaly-related questions, encompassing visual perception, causal interpretation, and risk-aware decision making. To support this task, we present a new dataset with 8,641 videos, where each video is annotated with diverse question types corresponding to different reasoning depths, totaling more than 50,000 samples, making it one of the largest datasets for video anomaly. The annotations are based on a structured Perception-Cognition-Action Chain-of-Thought (PerCoAct-CoT), which formalizes domain-specific reasoning priors for video anomaly understanding. This design enables systematic evaluation of multi-stage and adaptive anomaly reasoning. In addition, we propose Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to further enhance reasoning reliability under weak supervision. Building upon the proposed task and dataset, we develop an end-to-end MLLM-based VAR model termed Vad-R1-Plus, which supports adaptive hierarchical reasoning and risk-aware decision making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed benchmark and method effectively advance the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs on VAR tasks, outperforming both open-source and proprietary baselines.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D Scene Graph (3DSG) generation can enhance various downstream tasks in robotics, such as manipulation and navigation, by leveraging structured semantic representations. A 3DSG is constructed from multiple images of a scene, where objects are represented as nodes and relationships as edges. However, existing works for open-vocabulary 3DSG generation suffer from both low object-level recognition accuracy and speed, mainly due to constrained viewpoints, occlusions, and redundant surface density. To address these challenges, we propose RAG-3DSG to mitigate aggregation noise through re-shot guided uncertainty estimation and support object-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) via reliable low-uncertainty objects. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic downsample-mapping strategy to accelerate cross-image object aggregation with adaptive granularity. Experiments on Replica dataset demonstrate that RAG-3DSG significantly improves node captioning accuracy in 3DSG generation while reducing the mapping time by two-thirds compared to the vanilla version.

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to adaptively handle multiple restoration tasks with a single trained model. Although existing methods achieve promising results by introducing prompt information or leveraging large models, the added learning modules increase system complexity and hinder real-time applicability. In this paper, we adopt a physical degradation modeling perspective and predict a task-aware inverse degradation operator for efficient all-in-one image restoration. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, the predicted inverse operator produces an initial restored image together with an uncertainty perception map that highlights regions difficult to reconstruct, ensuring restoration reliability. In the second stage, the restoration is further refined under the guidance of this uncertainty map. The same inverse operator prediction network is used in both stages, with task-aware parameters introduced after operator prediction to adapt to different degradation tasks. Moreover, by accelerating the convolution of the inverse operator, the proposed method achieves efficient all-in-one image restoration. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, termed OPIR, is extensively validated through experiments, demonstrating superior all-in-one restoration performance while remaining highly competitive on task-aligned restoration.

Abstract: We introduce ELITE, an Efficient Gaussian head avatar synthesis from a monocular video via Learned Initialization and TEst-time generative adaptation. Prior works rely either on a 3D data prior or a 2D generative prior to compensate for missing visual cues in monocular videos. However, 3D data prior methods often struggle to generalize in-the-wild, while 2D generative prior methods are computationally heavy and prone to identity hallucination. We identify a complementary synergy between these two priors and design an efficient system that achieves high-fidelity animatable avatar synthesis with strong in-the-wild generalization. Specifically, we introduce a feed-forward Mesh2Gaussian Prior Model (MGPM) that enables fast initialization of a Gaussian avatar. To further bridge the domain gap at test time, we design a test-time generative adaptation stage, leveraging both real and synthetic images as supervision. Unlike previous full diffusion denoising strategies that are slow and hallucination-prone, we propose a rendering-guided single-step diffusion enhancer that restores missing visual details, grounded on Gaussian avatar renderings. Our experiments demonstrate that ELITE produces visually superior avatars to prior works, even for challenging expressions, while achieving 60x faster synthesis than the 2D generative prior method.

Abstract: Camera control has been extensively studied in conditioned video generation; however, performing precisely altering the camera trajectories while faithfully preserving the video content remains a challenging task. The mainstream approach to achieving precise camera control is warping a 3D representation according to the target trajectory. However, such methods fail to fully leverage the 3D priors of video diffusion models (VDMs) and often fall into the Inpainting Trap, resulting in subject inconsistency and degraded generation quality. To address this problem, we propose DepthDirector, a video re-rendering framework with precise camera controllability. By leveraging the depth video from explicit 3D representation as camera-control guidance, our method can faithfully reproduce the dynamic scene of an input video under novel camera trajectories. Specifically, we design a View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism that injects both the source video and the warped depth sequence rendered under the target viewpoint into the pretrained video generation model. This geometric guidance signal enables VDMs to comprehend camera movements and leverage their 3D understanding capabilities, thereby facilitating precise camera control and consistent content generation. Next, we introduce a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter to train our framework, fully preserving the knowledge priors of VDMs. Additionally, we construct a large-scale multi-camera synchronized dataset named MultiCam-WarpData using Unreal Engine 5, containing 8K videos across 1K dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments show that DepthDirector outperforms existing methods in both camera controllability and visual quality. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: Imagine sitting in a presentation, trying to follow the speaker while simultaneously scanning the slides for relevant information. While the entire slide is visible, identifying the relevant regions can be challenging. As you focus on one part of the slide, the speaker moves on to a new sentence, leaving you scrambling to catch up visually. This constant back-and-forth creates a disconnect between what is being said and the most important visual elements, making it hard to absorb key details, especially in fast-paced or content-heavy presentations such as conference talks. This requires an understanding of slides, including text, graphics, and layout. We introduce a method that automatically identifies and highlights the most relevant slide regions based on the speaker's narrative. By analyzing spoken content and matching it with textual or graphical elements in the slides, our approach ensures better synchronization between what listeners hear and what they need to attend to. We explore different ways of solving this problem and assess their success and failure cases. Analyzing multimedia documents is emerging as a key requirement for seamless understanding of content-rich videos, such as educational videos and conference talks, by reducing cognitive strain and improving comprehension.

Motivation: 当前针对视觉语言处理（VLP）模型的对抗攻击大多针对样本特定，导致在大规模数据集或新场景中扩展时计算成本高。HRA旨在通过在样本和优化级别上细化通用对抗扰动，减少这种限制。

Conclusion: HRA通过在样本和优化级别上细化通用对抗扰动，以及通过ScMix增强策略和优化路径的改进，提高了多模态通用攻击的有效性和稳定性，验证了其在实际应用中的优越性。

Abstract: Existing adversarial attacks for VLP models are mostly sample-specific, resulting in substantial computational overhead when scaled to large datasets or new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA), a multimodal universal attack framework for VLP models. HRA refines universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) at both the sample level and the optimization level. For the image modality, we disentangle adversarial examples into clean images and perturbations, allowing each component to be handled independently for more effective disruption of cross-modal alignment. We further introduce a ScMix augmentation strategy that diversifies visual contexts and strengthens both global and local utility of UAPs, thereby reducing reliance on spurious features. In addition, we refine the optimization path by leveraging a temporal hierarchy of historical and estimated future gradients to avoid local minima and stabilize universal perturbation learning. For the text modality, HRA identifies globally influential words by combining intra-sentence and inter-sentence importance measures, and subsequently utilizes these words as universal text perturbations. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed universal multimodal attacks.

Abstract: Recent Omni-multimodal Large Language Models show promise in unified audio, vision, and text modeling. However, streaming audio-video understanding remains challenging, as existing approaches suffer from disjointed capabilities: they typically exhibit incomplete modality support or lack autonomous proactive monitoring. To address this, we present ROMA, a real-time omni-multimodal assistant for unified reactive and proactive interaction. ROMA processes continuous inputs as synchronized multimodal units, aligning dense audio with discrete video frames to handle granularity mismatches. For online decision-making, we introduce a lightweight speak head that decouples response initiation from generation to ensure precise triggering without task conflict. We train ROMA with a curated streaming dataset and a two-stage curriculum that progressively optimizes for streaming format adaptation and proactive responsiveness. To standardize the fragmented evaluation landscape, we reorganize diverse benchmarks into a unified suite covering both proactive (alert, narration) and reactive (QA) settings. Extensive experiments across 12 benchmarks demonstrate ROMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on proactive tasks while competitive in reactive settings, validating its robustness in unified real-time omni-multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery exhibits intrinsic information sparsity due to its unique electromagnetic scattering mechanism. Despite the widespread adoption of deep neural network (DNN)-based SAR automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems, they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples and tend to over-rely on background regions, leading to degraded adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks for SAR-ATR often require visually perceptible distortions to achieve effective performance, thereby necessitating an attack method that balances effectiveness and stealthiness. In this paper, a novel attack method termed Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping (SRAW) is proposed, which generates adversarial examples through optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets across foreground and background regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAW significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art SAR-ATR models and consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of imperceptibility and adversarial transferability. Code is made available at https://github.com/boremycin/SAR-ATR-TransAttack.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models (DMs) has enabled high-quality visual synthesis from diverse textual prompts. Yet, most existing T2I DMs, even those equipped with large language model (LLM)-based text encoders, remain text-pixel mappers -- they employ LLMs merely as text encoders, without leveraging their inherent reasoning capabilities to infer what should be visually depicted given the textual prompt. To move beyond such literal generation, we propose the think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm, where the LLM-based text encoder is encouraged to reason about and rewrite raw user prompts; the states of the rewritten prompts then serve as diffusion conditioning. To achieve this, we first activate the think-then-rewrite pattern of the LLM encoder with a lightweight supervised fine-tuning process. Subsequently, the LLM encoder and diffusion backbone are co-optimized to ensure faithful reasoning about the context and accurate rendering of the semantics via Dual-GRPO. In particular, the text encoder is reinforced using image-grounded rewards to infer and recall world knowledge, while the diffusion backbone is pushed to produce semantically consistent and visually coherent images. Experiments show substantial improvements in factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism across reasoning-based image generation and editing benchmarks, achieving 0.79 on WISE score, nearly on par with GPT-4. Our results constitute a promising step toward next-generation unified models with reasoning, expression, and demonstration capacities.

Abstract: Supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to solve imaging inverse problems, achieving state-of-the-art performance in numerous applications. However, despite their empirical success, these methods are poorly understood from a theoretical perspective and often treated as black boxes. To bridge this gap, we analyze trained neural networks through the lens of the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator, incorporating functional constraints that capture two fundamental inductive biases of CNNs: translation equivariance and locality via finite receptive fields. Under the empirical training distribution, we derive an analytic, interpretable, and tractable formula for this constrained variant, termed Local-Equivariant MMSE (LE-MMSE). Through extensive numerical experiments across various inverse problems (denoising, inpainting, deconvolution), datasets (FFHQ, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST), and architectures (U-Net, ResNet, PatchMLP), we demonstrate that our theory matches the neural networks outputs (PSNR $\gtrsim25$dB). Furthermore, we provide insights into the differences between \emph{physics-aware} and \emph{physics-agnostic} estimators, the impact of high-density regions in the training (patch) distribution, and the influence of other factors (dataset size, patch size, etc).

Abstract: Text-guided human pose editing has gained significant traction in AIGC applications. However,it remains plagued by structural anomalies and generative artifacts. Existing evaluation metrics often isolate authenticity detection from quality assessment, failing to provide fine-grained insights into pose-specific inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce HPE-Bench, a specialized benchmark comprising 1,700 standardized samples from 17 state-of-the-art editing models, offering both authenticity labels and multi-dimensional quality scores. Furthermore, we propose a unified framework based on layer-selective multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By employing contrastive LoRA tuning and a novel layer sensitivity analysis (LSA) mechanism, we identify the optimal feature layer for pose evaluation. Our framework achieves superior performance in both authenticity detection and multi-dimensional quality regression, effectively bridging the gap between forensic detection and quality assessment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based generative priors have enabled visually plausible image compression at extremely low bit rates. However, existing approaches suffer from slow sampling processes and suboptimal bit allocation due to fragmented training paradigms. In this work, we propose Accelerate \textbf{Diff}usion-based Image Compression via \textbf{C}onsistency Prior \textbf{R}efinement (DiffCR), a novel compression framework for efficient and high-fidelity image reconstruction. At the heart of DiffCR is a Frequency-aware Skip Estimation (FaSE) module that refines the $ε$-prediction prior from a pre-trained latent diffusion model and aligns it with compressed latents at different timesteps via Frequency Decoupling Attention (FDA). Furthermore, a lightweight consistency estimator enables fast \textbf{two-step decoding} by preserving the semantic trajectory of diffusion sampling. Without updating the backbone diffusion model, DiffCR achieves substantial bitrate savings (27.2\% BD-rate (LPIPS) and 65.1\% BD-rate (PSNR)) and over $10\times$ speed-up compared to SOTA diffusion-based compression baselines.

Abstract: Recent achievements of vision-language models in end-to-end OCR point to a new avenue for low-loss compression of textual information. This motivates earlier works that render the Transformer's input into images for prefilling, which effectively reduces the number of tokens through visual encoding, thereby alleviating the quadratically increased Attention computations. However, this partial compression fails to save computational or memory costs at token-by-token inference. In this paper, we investigate global context compression, which saves tokens at both prefilling and inference stages. Consequently, we propose VIST2, a novel Transformer that interleaves input text chunks alongside their visual encoding, while depending exclusively on visual tokens in the pre-context to predict the next text token distribution. Around this idea, we render text chunks into sketch images and train VIST2 in multiple stages, starting from curriculum-scheduled pretraining for optical language modeling, followed by modal-interleaved instruction tuning. We conduct extensive experiments using VIST2 families scaled from 0.6B to 8B to explore the training recipe and hyperparameters. With a 4$\times$ compression ratio, the resulting models demonstrate significant superiority over baselines on long writing tasks, achieving, on average, a 3$\times$ speedup in first-token generation, 77% reduction in memory usage, and 74% reduction in FLOPS. Our codes and datasets will be public to support further studies.

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) requires the integration of heterogeneous clinical, radiological, and histopathological information. While Multimodal Deep Learning (MDL) offers a promises for precision prognosis and survival prediction, its clinical applicability is severely limited by small cohort sizes and the presence of missing modalities, often forcing complete-case filtering or aggressive imputation. In this work, we present a missing-aware multimodal survival framework that integrates Computed Tomography (CT), Whole-Slide Histopathology (WSI) Images, and structured clinical variables for overall survival modeling in unresectable stage II-III NSCLC. By leveraging Foundation Models (FM) for modality-specific feature extraction and a missing-aware encoding strategy, the proposed approach enables intermediate multimodal fusion under naturally incomplete modality profiles. The proposed architecture is resilient to missing modalities by design, allowing the model to utilize all available data without being forced to drop patients during training or inference. Experimental results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperforms unimodal baselines as well as early and late fusion strategies, with the strongest performance achieved by the fusion of WSI and clinical modalities (73.30 C-index). Further analyses of modality importance reveal an adaptive behavior in which less informative modalities, i.e., CT modality, are automatically down-weighted and contribute less to the final survival prediction.

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is widely employed for the analysis of living biological samples; however, the utility of the resulting recordings is frequently constrained by noise, temporal variability, and inconsistent visualisation of signals that oscillate over time. We present a unique computational framework that integrates information from multiple time-resolved frames into a single high-quality image, while preserving the underlying biological content of the original video. We evaluate the proposed method through an extensive number of configurations (n = 111) and on a challenging dataset comprising dynamic, heterogeneous, and morphologically complex 2D monolayers of cardiac cells. Results show that our framework, which consists of a combination of explainable techniques from different computer vision application fields, is capable of generating composite images that preserve and enhance the quality and information of individual microscopy frames, yielding 44% average increase in cell count compared to previous methods. The proposed pipeline is applicable to other imaging domains that require the fusion of multi-temporal image stacks into high-quality 2D images, thereby facilitating annotation and downstream segmentation.

Abstract: We address the problem of estimating realistic, spatially varying reflectance for complex planetary surfaces such as the lunar regolith, which is critical for high-fidelity rendering and vision-based navigation. Existing lunar rendering pipelines rely on simplified or spatially uniform BRDF models whose parameters are difficult to estimate and fail to capture local reflectance variations, limiting photometric realism. We propose Lunar-G2R, a geometry-to-reflectance learning framework that predicts spatially varying BRDF parameters directly from a lunar digital elevation model (DEM), without requiring multi-view imagery, controlled illumination, or dedicated reflectance-capture hardware at inference time. The method leverages a U-Net trained with differentiable rendering to minimize photometric discrepancies between real orbital images and physically based renderings under known viewing and illumination geometry. Experiments on a geographically held-out region of the Tycho crater show that our approach reduces photometric error by 38 % compared to a state-of-the-art baseline, while achieving higher PSNR and SSIM and improved perceptual similarity, capturing fine-scale reflectance variations absent from spatially uniform models. To our knowledge, this is the first method to infer a spatially varying reflectance model directly from terrain geometry.

Abstract: As hubs of human activity, urban surfaces consist of a wealth of semantic entities. Segmenting these various entities from satellite imagery is crucial for a range of downstream applications. Current advanced segmentation models can reliably segment entities defined by physical attributes (e.g., buildings, water bodies) but still struggle with socially defined categories (e.g., schools, parks). In this work, we achieve socio-semantic segmentation by vision-language model reasoning. To facilitate this, we introduce the Urban Socio-Semantic Segmentation dataset named SocioSeg, a new resource comprising satellite imagery, digital maps, and pixel-level labels of social semantic entities organized in a hierarchical structure. Additionally, we propose a novel vision-language reasoning framework called SocioReasoner that simulates the human process of identifying and annotating social semantic entities via cross-modal recognition and multi-stage reasoning. We employ reinforcement learning to optimize this non-differentiable process and elicit the reasoning capabilities of the vision-language model. Experiments demonstrate our approach's gains over state-of-the-art models and strong zero-shot generalization. Our dataset and code are available in https://github.com/AMAP-ML/SocioReasoner.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的持续微调方法MERGETUNE，它允许在零样本模型微调之后恢复预训练知识，而不需要大规模的数据重放。实验表明MERGETUNE在CoOp模型上实现了比CLIP更高的性能，并且在鲁棒微调评估中超过了ensemble基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在微调视觉-语言模型（VLMs）时，预训练知识常常被遗忘，而现有方法多致力于在适应过程中减轻遗忘，但遗忘不可避免。本文提出了CFT方法，即持续微调策略（MERGETUNE），以恢复已经适应的零样本模型的预训练知识。

Method: MERGETUNE首先通过连续微调可训练参数，寻找一个同时与零样本和微调模型具有低损失路径的模型。该方法利用损失景观的几何结构，隐式地将两个解决方案融合在一起，恢复了微调模型丢失的预训练知识。此外，作者定义了一种基于二阶近似的线性模式连通性（LMC）约束替代，避免了大规模数据重放。

Result: 实验结果表明，MERGETUNE在CoOp模型上实现了优于CLIP的性能，增益达到5.6%。该方法还证明了在跨数据集迁移任务中优于CLIP。在鲁棒微调评估中，MERGETUNE所得到的LMC合并模型表现超过了ensemble基线，并且在与零样本模型共同ensemble时实现了最新的性能。

Conclusion: MERGETUNE提供了一种新的途径，在零样本模型适应后恢复预训练知识，同时减少了数据重放的需求，实证展示了在多个任务上的优越性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP often leads to catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge. Prior work primarily aims to mitigate forgetting during adaptation; however, forgetting often remains inevitable during this process. We introduce a novel paradigm, \emph{continued fine-tuning (CFT)}, which seeks to recover pretrained knowledge after a zero-shot model has already been adapted. We propose a simple, model-agnostic CFT strategy (named MERGETUNE) guided by linear mode connectivity (LMC), which can be applied post hoc to existing fine-tuned models without requiring architectural changes. Given a fine-tuned model, we continue fine-tuning its trainable parameters (e.g., soft prompts or linear heads) to search for a continued model which has two low-loss paths to the zero-shot (e.g., CLIP) and the fine-tuned (e.g., CoOp) solutions. By exploiting the geometry of the loss landscape, the continued model implicitly merges the two solutions, restoring pretrained knowledge lost in the fine-tuned counterpart. A challenge is that the vanilla LMC constraint requires data replay from the pretraining task. We approximate this constraint for the zero-shot model via a second-order surrogate, eliminating the need for large-scale data replay. Experiments show that MERGETUNE improves the harmonic mean of CoOp by +5.6\% on base-novel generalisation without adding parameters. % We show \emph{the first time} superior performance than CLIP on both DTD and EuroSAT, on cross-dataset transfer. On robust fine-tuning evaluations, the LMC-merged model from MERGETUNE surpasses ensemble baselines with lower inference cost, achieving further gains and state-of-the-art results when ensembled with the zero-shot model. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/Surrey-UP-Lab/MERGETUNE}{https://github.com/Surrey-UP-Lab/MERGETUNE}.

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction is an essential part of a safe and robust end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) pipeline. Onboard camera-based approaches suffer from limited depth perception and degraded accuracy due to occlusion. In this work, we propose SatMap, an online vectorized HD map estimation method that integrates satellite maps with multi-view camera observations and directly predicts a vectorized HD map for downstream prediction and planning modules. Our method leverages lane-level semantics and texture from satellite imagery captured from a Bird's Eye View (BEV) perspective as a global prior, effectively mitigating depth ambiguity and occlusion. In our experiments on the nuScenes dataset, SatMap achieves 34.8% mAP performance improvement over the camera-only baseline and 8.5% mAP improvement over the camera-LiDAR fusion baseline. Moreover, we evaluate our model in long-range and adverse weather conditions to demonstrate the advantages of using a satellite prior map.

Abstract: The automated creation of digital twins and precise asset inventories is a critical task in smart city construction and facility lifecycle management. However, utilizing cost-effective sparse imagery remains challenging due to limited robustness, inaccurate localization, and a lack of fine-grained state understanding. To address these limitations, SVII-3D, a unified framework for holistic asset digitization, is proposed. First, LoRA fine-tuned open-set detection is fused with a spatial-attention matching network to robustly associate observations across sparse views. Second, a geometry-guided refinement mechanism is introduced to resolve structural errors, achieving precise decimeter-level 3D localization. Third, transcending static geometric mapping, a Vision-Language Model agent leveraging multi-modal prompting is incorporated to automatically diagnose fine-grained operational states. Experiments demonstrate that SVII-3D significantly improves identification accuracy and minimizes localization errors. Consequently, this framework offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for high-fidelity infrastructure digitization, effectively bridging the gap between sparse perception and automated intelligent maintenance.

Abstract: Images captured in hazy and smoky environments suffer from reduced visibility, posing a challenge when monitoring infrastructures and hindering emergency services during critical situations. The proposed work investigates the use of the deep learning models to enhance the automatic, machine-based readability of gauge in smoky environments, with accurate gauge data interpretation serving as a valuable tool for first responders. The study utilizes two deep learning architectures, FFA-Net and AECR-Net, to improve the visibility of gauge images, corrupted with light up to dense haze and smoke. Since benchmark datasets of analog gauge images are unavailable, a new synthetic dataset, containing over 14,000 images, was generated using the Unreal Engine. The models were trained with an 80\% train, 10\% validation, and 10\% test split for the haze and smoke dataset, respectively. For the synthetic haze dataset, the SSIM and PSNR metrics are about 0.98 and 43\,dB, respectively, comparing well to state-of-the art results. Additionally, more robust results are retrieved from the AECR-Net, when compared to the FFA-Net. Although the results from the synthetic smoke dataset are poorer, the trained models achieve interesting results. In general, imaging in the presence of smoke are more difficult to enhance given the inhomogeneity and high density. Secondly, FFA-Net and AECR-Net are implemented to dehaze and not to desmoke images. This work shows that use of deep learning architectures can improve the quality of analog gauge images captured in smoke and haze scenes immensely. Finally, the enhanced output images can be successfully post-processed for automatic autonomous reading of gauges

Abstract: Automated perception of urban roadside infrastructure is crucial for smart city management, yet general-purpose models often struggle to capture the necessary fine-grained attributes and domain rules. While Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at open-world recognition, they often struggle to accurately interpret complex facility states in compliance with engineering standards, leading to unreliable performance in real-world applications. To address this, we propose a domain-adapted framework that transforms VLMs into specialized agents for intelligent infrastructure analysis. Our approach integrates a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy with a knowledge-grounded reasoning mechanism. Specifically, we leverage open-vocabulary fine-tuning on Grounding DINO to robustly localize diverse assets with minimal supervision, followed by LoRA-based adaptation on Qwen-VL for deep semantic attribute reasoning. To mitigate hallucinations and enforce professional compliance, we introduce a dual-modality Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that dynamically retrieves authoritative industry standards and visual exemplars during inference. Evaluated on a comprehensive new dataset of urban roadside scenes, our framework achieves a detection performance of 58.9 mAP and an attribute recognition accuracy of 95.5%, demonstrating a robust solution for intelligent infrastructure monitoring.

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models produce promising visual content yet often violate basic physics principles, limiting their utility. While some attribute this deficiency to insufficient physics understanding from pre-training, we find that the shortfall in physics plausibility also stems from suboptimal inference strategies. We therefore introduce WMReward and treat improving physics plausibility of video generation as an inference-time alignment problem. In particular, we leverage the strong physics prior of a latent world model (here, VJEPA-2) as a reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling test-time compute for better generation performance. Empirically, our approach substantially improves physics plausibility across image-conditioned, multiframe-conditioned, and text-conditioned generation settings, with validation from human preference study. Notably, in the ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge, we achieve a final score of 62.64%, winning first place and outperforming the previous state of the art by 7.42%. Our work demonstrates the viability of using latent world models to improve physics plausibility of video generation, beyond this specific instantiation or parameterization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究旨在通过开发DeepUrban数据集来加强自动驾驶系统在密集城市环境中的轨迹预测和规划能力，该数据集提供了丰富的3D交通对象信息，有助于提高车辆预测和规划的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: The efficacy of autonomous driving systems hinges critically on robust prediction and planning capabilities. However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users. To address this gap, we collaborated with our industrial partner, DeepScenario, to develop DeepUrban-a new drone dataset designed to enhance trajectory prediction and planning benchmarks focusing on dense urban settings. DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

*Serena Grazia De Benedictis,Amedeo Altavilla,Nicoletta Del Buono*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Jordan Curve定理的拓扑感知分割方法，通过数字拓扑和同调理论分析分割掩膜，定义了一种确保图像被拓扑分割成两个连通区域的掩膜，为评估分割掩膜的结构一致性提供了数学严谨且自动化的标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于像素、区域或边界的关键评价指标难以捕捉分割的结构和拓扑连贯性，在医疗成像或目标轮廓化等实际场景中，小的边界偏差或不规则预测可能得到高分，但导致物体的整体形状或连接性丧失。因此，需要一种方法来评估预测分割是否能够正确地将图像分割成有意义的内部和外部区域。

Method: 本文基于Jordan Curve定理，提出了一个拓扑感知的分割方法，定义了确保图像域被分为两个连通组件的Jordan-segmentatable掩膜。通过数字拓扑和同调理论（Betti数的使用）来验证掩膜的拓扑有效性。

Result: 通过本文的方法，分割掩膜可以被评估为是否形成了一个拓扑有效的4-曲线，即Betti数β_0 = β_1 = 1，等价于掩膜的补足恰好可以被划分为两个8-连通组件。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法提供了一种数学上严谨且无需监督的评估标准，能够评价分割掩膜的结构一致性。特别是在需要保持拓扑正确性的应用场景中，这种方法提供了一个更优越的评价指标替代方案。

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a central role in computer vision. However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.
  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $β_0 = β_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.
  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过揭示防御性差的深度学习模型如何可能被白盒攻击利用，论文旨在提高对模型安全性的理解。

Method: 该方法利用SHAP（SHapley Additive exPlanations）值量化输入对输出的影响，并将其应用于计算SHAP攻击，以发现模型在推理阶段的弱点。

Result: 研究表明，SHAP攻击在梯度隐藏场景中比Fast Gradient Sign Method更具鲁棒性，能够造成更明显的误分类。

Conclusion: 论文得出了SHAP方法在对抗性攻击中的有效性及其在检测模型弱点中的潜力，同时建议未来的研究可以进一步探索此类攻击的防御措施。

Abstract: The paper introduces a white-box attack on computer vision models using SHAP values. It demonstrates how adversarial evasion attacks can compromise the performance of deep learning models by reducing output confidence or inducing misclassifications. Such attacks are particularly insidious as they can deceive the perception of an algorithm while eluding human perception due to their imperceptibility to the human eye. The proposed attack leverages SHAP values to quantify the significance of individual inputs to the output at the inference stage. A comparison is drawn between the SHAP attack and the well-known Fast Gradient Sign Method. We find evidence that SHAP attacks are more robust in generating misclassifications particularly in gradient hiding scenarios.

TL;DR: RSATalker是首个利用3D高斯散列生成真实且社交感知的多轮对话虚拟头像的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在一些局限性，而RSATalker致力于解决这些问题，提供了一种高效、自然、并能理解社会关系的解决方案。

Method: RSATalker通过驱动基于网格的3D面部运动并结合3D高斯模型进行2D渲染，提出了一种社会感知模块来捕捉人际动态。

Result: 实验表明，RSATalker在逼真度和社会意识方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出了RSATalker框架，提供了一个包含语音-网格-图像三元组并标注了社会关系的数据集，并将发布源代码和数据集。

Abstract: Talking head generation is increasingly important in virtual reality (VR), especially for social scenarios involving multi-turn conversation. Existing approaches face notable limitations: mesh-based 3D methods can model dual-person dialogue but lack realistic textures, while large-model-based 2D methods produce natural appearances but incur prohibitive computational costs. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based methods achieve efficient and realistic rendering but remain speaker-only and ignore social relationships. We introduce RSATalker, the first framework that leverages 3DGS for realistic and socially-aware talking head generation with support for multi-turn conversation. Our method first drives mesh-based 3D facial motion from speech, then binds 3D Gaussians to mesh facets to render high-fidelity 2D avatar videos. To capture interpersonal dynamics, we propose a socially-aware module that encodes social relationships, including blood and non-blood as well as equal and unequal, into high-level embeddings through a learnable query mechanism. We design a three-stage training paradigm and construct the RSATalker dataset with speech-mesh-image triplets annotated with social relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSATalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in both realism and social awareness. The code and dataset will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了Molmo2，一种新的开源VLM系列模型，该系列模型在多种图像和视频任务中表现出色，尤其在目标点驱动的定位能力上实现了显著突破，并提供了新的数据集和训练方法以增强模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最强的视频-语言模型基本上为私有，而开放的模型要么依赖于从私有模型中提取的数据，要么不披露其训练数据或方法。这限制了开源社区在改进最先进的视频与图像语言模型的贡献。因此，研究旨在填补这一空白，开发全新的开源视频-语言模型，具备点驱动的视觉定位能力，并提供新的训练数据以提升模型性能。

Method: 研究人员使用了一种高效的打包和消息树编码方案，并结合双向注意力机制和新颖的令牌权重策略来训练模型。他们设计了7个新的视频数据集和2个图像数据集，包括视频字幕数据集、问答数据集、对象跟踪数据集和视频指针数据集。所有这些数据集的收集都没有依赖于密闭的VLM。

Result: 研究的8B模型在各类开放数据和权重模型中表现出卓越的性能。在短视频领域，它超越了其他模型，在计数和描述任务上表现尤为突出。在视频定位任务中，与现有开放模型Qwen3-VL相比，Molmo2显著提升了准确率（35.5 vs 29.6）。在视频跟踪任务上，该模型性能也优于专有模型Gemini 3 Pro。

Conclusion: 总之，Molmo2模型及其所贡献的新数据集和训练方法显著提升了开源模型在视频和图像任务中的效果，为该领域的进一步发展提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: Today's strongest video-language models (VLMs) remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了CoMoVi框架，通过一种双重分支扩散模型，同步生成3D人体动作和视频。该模型结合了预训练视频模型的优势，并通过文本和动作注释的大量实际视频数据集进行训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现3D人体动作与2D人体视频生成是相互关联的，3D动作定义了视频的结构先验，确保视频的合理性和一致性，同时，预训练的视频模型提供了强大的泛化能力。基于此，提出了CoMoVi框架来解决这两方面的生成。

Method: 本文提出了一种双重分支扩散模型，用于同步生成3D人体动作和视频。首先，设计了一种有效的2D人体运动表示方法，以继承预训练视频模型的强大先验信息。然后，构建了一个双向分支扩散模型，实现了人体运动和视频生成过程的相互特征交互和3D-2D跨注意力机制。

Result: 实验表明，CoMoVi框架在3D人体动作和视频生成任务中表现有效。

Conclusion: 本文构建的CoMoVi框架通过一种双向分支扩散模型有效地同步生成3D人体动作和视频，显著提高了动作和视频的一致性和合理性。

Abstract: In this paper, we find that the generation of 3D human motions and 2D human videos is intrinsically coupled. 3D motions provide the structural prior for plausibility and consistency in videos, while pre-trained video models offer strong generalization capabilities for motions, which necessitate coupling their generation processes. Based on this, we present CoMoVi, a co-generative framework that couples two video diffusion models (VDMs) to generate 3D human motions and videos synchronously within a single diffusion denoising loop. To achieve this, we first propose an effective 2D human motion representation that can inherit the powerful prior of pre-trained VDMs. Then, we design a dual-branch diffusion model to couple human motion and video generation process with mutual feature interaction and 3D-2D cross attentions. Moreover, we curate CoMoVi Dataset, a large-scale real-world human video dataset with text and motion annotations, covering diverse and challenging human motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both 3D human motion and video generation tasks.

TL;DR: CURVE是一个多文化多语言的视频理解基准，旨在解决现有的视频模型评价中文化偏见问题。它包括来自18个全球地区的高质量人工生成注释的视频，并提供复杂的多步骤推理问题，问题均用本地语言编写。通过CURVE的推理踪迹，提出了一种新的迭代策略以识别推理中的细微错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视频理解基准数据集主要集中在西方文化上，使用英语为主，无法全面评估视频模型在不同文化背景下的理解能力，存在文化偏见问题。为了解决这一问题，文章提出了一个新的多文化多语言视频理解基准CURVE。

Method: CURVE包含18个全球地区的高质量、完全由人类生成的注释视频，提供了复杂的问题、答案和多步骤的推理过程，全部使用当地语言编写。同时通过利用CURVE的推理过程，构造基于证据的图形，提出了一种新的迭代策略来识别推理中的细微错误。

Result: 现有最先进的视频理解模型（Video-LLMs）在CURVE上表现不佳，与人类水平的准确度有很大差距，主要错误来源是文化元素的视觉感知。

Conclusion: CURVE为多文化多语言视频理解研究提供了新的挑战基准，并且有助于提高模型对文化多样性的理解。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video models have shown tremendous progress, particularly in long video understanding. However, current benchmarks predominantly feature western-centric data and English as the dominant language, introducing significant biases in evaluation. To address this, we introduce CURVE (Cultural Understanding and Reasoning in Video Evaluation), a challenging benchmark for multicultural and multilingual video reasoning. CURVE comprises high-quality, entirely human-generated annotations from diverse, region-specific cultural videos across 18 global locales. Unlike prior work that relies on automatic translations, CURVE provides complex questions, answers, and multi-step reasoning steps, all crafted in native languages. Making progress on CURVE requires a deeply situated understanding of visual cultural context. Furthermore, we leverage CURVE's reasoning traces to construct evidence-based graphs and propose a novel iterative strategy using these graphs to identify fine-grained errors in reasoning. Our evaluations reveal that SoTA Video-LLMs struggle significantly, performing substantially below human-level accuracy, with errors primarily stemming from the visual perception of cultural elements. CURVE will be publicly available under https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune?tab=readme-ov-file\#minerva-cultural

TL;DR: 该研究分析表明，通过随机掩蔽部分补丁特征，提高政策模型在不熟悉数据分布场景中的鲁棒性、泛化能力和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的端到端自动驾驶政策模型在遇到未见过的数据分布时（即Out-of-Distribution，OOD）表现不佳，主要原因是补丁特征中的冗余信息导致模型过度拟合于表面关联，而非实际关系。

Method: 该研究提出了Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS) 方法，该方法在每个帧中随机覆盖一部分补丁特征，使得模型在训练过程中接触到多样的视图，同时保留场景的空间布局。

Result: 实验表明，使用SPS方法训练的模型在所有OOD场景中表现优于现有最佳方法，平均提升6.2%，在闭环模拟中提升20.4%，并具备2.4倍的计算效率。

Conclusion: SPS方法简化且有效，能够在保持自动驾驶系统性能的同时显著提升其在未知数据分布环境下的鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving show that policies trained on patch-aligned features extracted from foundation models generalize better to Out-of-Distribution (OOD). We hypothesize that due to the self-attention mechanism, each patch feature implicitly embeds/contains information from all other patches, represented in a different way and intensity, making these descriptors highly redundant. We quantify redundancy in such (BLIP2) features via PCA and cross-patch similarity: $90$% of variance is captured by $17/64$ principal components, and strong inter-token correlations are pervasive. Training on such overlapping information leads the policy to overfit spurious correlations, hurting OOD robustness. We present Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS), a simple yet effective approach for learning policies that are more robust, generalizable, and efficient. For every frame, SPS randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors, not feeding them to the policy model, while preserving the spatial layout of the remaining patches. Thus, the policy is provided with different stochastic but complete views of the (same) scene: every random subset of patches acts like a different, yet still sensible, coherent projection of the world. The policy thus bases its decisions on features that are invariant to which specific tokens survive. Extensive experiments confirm that across all OOD scenarios, our method outperforms the state of the art (SOTA), achieving a $6.2$% average improvement and up to $20.4$% in closed-loop simulations, while being $2.4\times$ faster. We conduct ablations over masking rates and patch-feature reorganization, training and evaluating 9 systems, with 8 of them surpassing prior SOTA. Finally, we show that the same learned policy transfers to a physical, real-world car without any tuning.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种名为Cross-Layer Injection (CLI)的新框架，通过动态构建视觉和语言模态之间的桥梁，增强了视觉语言模型（VLMs）的多模态理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型存在视觉特征瓶颈问题，由于其静态架构，导致大规模语言模型难以实现与视觉知识的全面对齐，从而影响了其推理能力。

Method: 该研究提出了一种CLI框架，包含Adaptive Multi-Projection (AMP) 和Adaptive Gating Fusion (AGF)两个模块，AMP可以适配视觉层中的多种特征，AGF允许大规模语言模型根据解码上下文动态性地注入相关视觉信息。

Result: 在18个不同基准上的实验表明，整合CLI可以显著提高模型性能，证明了CLI作为可扩展的范式的有效性。

Conclusion: CLI框架提高了大规模语言模型对早期视觉表示的学习能力，被认为是多模态理解的一步重大进展。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) create a severe visual feature bottleneck by using a crude, asymmetric connection that links only the output of the vision encoder to the input of the large language model (LLM). This static architecture fundamentally limits the ability of LLMs to achieve comprehensive alignment with hierarchical visual knowledge, compromising their capacity to accurately integrate local details with global semantics into coherent reasoning. To resolve this, we introduce Cross-Layer Injection (CLI), a novel and lightweight framework that forges a dynamic many-to-many bridge between the two modalities. CLI consists of two synergistic, parameter-efficient components: an Adaptive Multi-Projection (AMP) module that harmonizes features from diverse vision layers, and an Adaptive Gating Fusion (AGF) mechanism that empowers the LLM to selectively inject the most relevant visual information based on its real-time decoding context. We validate the effectiveness and versatility of CLI by integrating it into LLaVA-OneVision and LLaVA-1.5. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements, establishing CLI as a scalable paradigm that unlocks deeper multimodal understanding by granting LLMs on-demand access to the full visual hierarchy.

TL;DR: 介绍了Alterbute方法，这是一种基于扩散的图像中对象内在属性编辑方法，能够在保持对象身份和场景上下文的同时改变颜色、纹理、材质甚至形状。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖于无法可靠保持身份的无监督先验，要么使用过于严格的监督，限制了有意义的内在属性变化。因此需要一种新的方法，在保持对象身份的情况下，能够灵活编辑对象的内在属性。

Method: 利用一个放宽的训练目标，考虑身份参考图像、文本提示和背景图像及目标掩模，从大型公共图像数据集中自动提取细粒度视图命名实体(VNE)标签及其相应的内在属性描述，构建视觉语言模型以实现大规模、保持身份的监督。

Result: 实验表明，相较于现有方法，Alterbute在保持对象身份前提下，有效实现了对象内在属性的编辑。

Conclusion: Alterbute能够在保持对象身份的同时，提供更灵活、更强大的内在属性编辑能力，尤其是在颜色、纹理、材质和形状的调整方面有显著优势，为图像编辑领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Alterbute, a diffusion-based method for editing an object's intrinsic attributes in an image. We allow changing color, texture, material, and even the shape of an object, while preserving its perceived identity and scene context. Existing approaches either rely on unsupervised priors that often fail to preserve identity or use overly restrictive supervision that prevents meaningful intrinsic variations. Our method relies on: (i) a relaxed training objective that allows the model to change both intrinsic and extrinsic attributes conditioned on an identity reference image, a textual prompt describing the target intrinsic attributes, and a background image and object mask defining the extrinsic context. At inference, we restrict extrinsic changes by reusing the original background and object mask, thereby ensuring that only the desired intrinsic attributes are altered; (ii) Visual Named Entities (VNEs) - fine-grained visual identity categories (e.g., ''Porsche 911 Carrera'') that group objects sharing identity-defining features while allowing variation in intrinsic attributes. We use a vision-language model to automatically extract VNE labels and intrinsic attribute descriptions from a large public image dataset, enabling scalable, identity-preserving supervision. Alterbute outperforms existing methods on identity-preserving object intrinsic attribute editing.

TL;DR: WildRayZer 提出了一种自我监督的框架，用于动态环境中的新颖视角合成。通过分析和综合的方法，处理了动态内容导致的多视角一致性问题，解决了鬼影、幻象几何和不稳定姿态估计等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于现有静态新颖视角合成模型在动态场景下难以处理动态内容导致的问题，提出了 WildRayZer 框架来改进效果。

Method: WildRayZer 采用摄像头仅静态渲染来解释刚性结构，并基于残差构造伪运动蒙版，提取运动估计，并以此掩蔽输入令牌和控制损失梯度，使监督关注于跨视图背景填充。

Result: 实验结果表明，WildRayZer 在过渡区域去除和全帧新颖视角合成质量方面，均优于基于优化和前馈基线方法。

Conclusion: WildRayZer 应用改进的数据集并利用自我监督方法，在动态场景下的新颖视角合成中表现优异。

Abstract: We present WildRayZer, a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis (NVS) in dynamic environments where both the camera and objects move. Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS. Experiments show that WildRayZer consistently outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种适用于下一次表达预测的新方法ProUtt。通过生成偏好推理和非偏好推理过程，ProUtt为预测用户的意图提供了有效手段，并且其性能超出了现有的其他方法。

Abstract: Proactively predicting a users next utterance in human-machine dialogue can streamline interaction and improve user experience. Existing commercial API-based solutions are subject to privacy concerns while deploying general-purpose LLMs locally remains computationally expensive. As such, training a compact, task-specific LLM provides a practical alternative. Although user simulator methods can predict a user's next utterance, they mainly imitate their speaking style rather than advancing the dialogue. Preference data synthesis has been investigated to generate data for proactive next utterance prediction and help align LLMs with user preferences. Yet existing methods lack the ability to explicitly model the intent reasoning that leads to the user's next utterance and to define and synthesize preference and non-preference reasoning processes for predicting the user's next utterance.To address these challenges, we propose ProUtt, an LLM-driven preference data synthesis method for proactive next utterance prediction. ProUtt converts dialogue history into an intent tree and explicitly models intent reasoning trajectories by predicting the next plausible path from both exploitation and exploration perspectives. It then constructs preference and non-preference reasoning processes by perturbing or revising intent tree paths at different future turns. Extensive evaluations using LLM-as-a-judge and human judgments demonstrate that ProUtt consistently outperforms existing data synthesis methods, user simulators, and commercial LLM APIs across four benchmark datasets. We release both the code and the synthesized datasets to facilitate future research.

Chatbots have evolved into sophisticated AI-driven systems capable of automating complex workflows, including policy recommendation and claims triage, while simultaneously enabling dynamic, context-aware user engagement. This paper presents the design, implementation, and empirical evaluation of Axlerod, an AI-powered conversational interface designed to improve the operational efficiency of independent insurance agents. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and domain-specific knowledge integration, Axlerod demonstrates robust capabilities in parsing user intent, accessing structured policy databases, and delivering real-time, contextually relevant responses. Experimental results underscore Axlerod's effectiveness, achieving an overall accuracy of 93.18% in policy retrieval tasks while reducing the average search time by 2.42 seconds. This work contributes to the growing body of research on enterprise-grade AI applications in insurtech, with a particular focus on agent-assistive rather than consumer-facing architectures.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is rapidly transforming research methodologies across disciplines, yet African languages remain largely underrepresented in this technological shift. This paper provides the first comprehensive overview of NLP progress and challenges for the six national languages officially recognized by the Senegalese Constitution: Wolof, Pulaar, Sereer, Joola, Mandingue, and Soninke. We synthesize linguistic, sociotechnical, and infrastructural factors that shape their digital readiness and identify gaps in data, tools, and benchmarks. Building on existing initiatives and research works, we analyze ongoing efforts in text normalization, machine translation, and speech processing. We also provide a centralized GitHub repository that compiles publicly accessible resources for a range of NLP tasks across these languages, designed to facilitate collaboration and reproducibility. A special focus is devoted to the application of NLP to the social sciences, where multilingual transcription, translation, and retrieval pipelines can significantly enhance the efficiency and inclusiveness of field research. The paper concludes by outlining a roadmap toward sustainable, community-centered NLP ecosystems for Senegalese languages, emphasizing ethical data governance, open resources, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

Abstract: This study investigates how to efficiently build a domain-specialized large language model (LLM) for statistics using the lightweight LLaMA-3.2-3B family as the foundation model (FM). We systematically compare three multi-stage training pipelines, starting from a base FM with no instruction-following capability, a base FM augmented with post-hoc instruction tuning, and an instruction-tuned FM with strong general reasoning abilities across continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) preference alignment, and downstream task adaptation. Results show that pipelines beginning with a base FM fail to develop meaningful statistical reasoning, even after extensive instruction tuning, SFT, or RLHF alignment. In contrast, starting from LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct enables effective domain specialization. A comprehensive evaluation of SFT variants reveals clear trade-offs between domain expertise and general reasoning ability. We further demonstrate that direct preference optimization provides stable and effective RLHF preference alignment. Finally, we show that downstream fine-tuning must be performed with extremely low intensity to avoid catastrophic forgetting in highly optimized models. The final model, StatLLaMA, achieves strong and balanced performance on benchmarks of mathematical reasoning, common-sense reasoning, and statistical expertise, offering a practical blueprint for developing resource-efficient statistical LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/HuangDLab/StatLLaMA.

Abstract: Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN) is the de facto choice for large language models (LLMs) and is crucial for stable pretraining and effective transfer learning. However, Pre-LN is inefficient due to repeated statistical calculations and suffers from the curse of depth. As layers grow, the magnitude and variance of the hidden state escalate, destabilizing training. Efficiency-oriented normalization-free methods such as Dynamic Tanh (DyT) improve speed but remain fragile at depth. To jointly address stability and efficiency, we propose Bounded Hyperbolic Tanh (BHyT), a drop-in replacement for Pre-LN. BHyT couples a tanh nonlinearity with explicit, data-driven input bounding to keep activations within a non-saturating range. It prevents depth-wise growth in activation magnitude and variance and comes with a theoretical stability guarantee. For efficiency, BHyT computes exact statistics once per block and replaces a second normalization with a lightweight variance approximation, enhancing efficiency. Empirically, BHyT demonstrates improved stability and efficiency during pretraining, achieving an average of 15.8% faster training and an average of 4.2% higher token generation throughput compared to RMSNorm., while matching or surpassing its inference performance and robustness across language understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BHyT

Abstract: Question answering (QA) systems are increasingly deployed across domains. However, their reliability is undermined when retrieved evidence is incomplete, noisy, or uncertain. Existing knowledge graph (KG) based QA frameworks typically represent facts as static and deterministic, failing to capture the evolving nature of information and the uncertainty inherent in reasoning. We present a demonstration of uncertainty-aware dynamic KGs, a framework that combines (i) dynamic construction of evolving KGs, (ii) confidence scoring and uncertainty-aware retrieval, and (iii) an interactive interface for reliable and interpretable QA. Our system highlights how uncertainty modeling can make QA more robust and transparent by enabling users to explore dynamic graphs, inspect confidence-annotated triples, and compare baseline versus confidence-aware answers. The target users of this demo are clinical data scientists and clinicians, and we instantiate the framework in healthcare: constructing personalized KGs from electronic health records, visualizing uncertainty across patient visits, and evaluating its impact on a mortality prediction task. This use case demonstrates the broader promise of uncertainty-aware dynamic KGs for enhancing QA reliability in high-stakes applications.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了在儿科咨询中，大型语言模型（LLM）在家长焦虑驱动的对抗压力下的安全性，并发现较小模型在对抗性条件下表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 背景指出，虽然LLM在医疗咨询中广泛应用，但其在现实用户压力下的安全性尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在针对这种情况，通过PediatricAnxietyBench 来评估LLM在儿科咨询中的对抗压力安全性。

Method: 使用了包含300个查询的PediatricAnxietyBench（包括150个真实查询和150个对抗查询），针对三个模型（Llama-3.3-70B，Llama-3.1-8B和Mistral-7B）进行了评估，共产生了900个响应。通过0-15分制指标来评估安全性，分析采用了配对t检验法。

Result: 结果显示，不同模型的安全性能评分差距最小的Llama-3.1-8B为9.70分，最强的Mistral-7B为10.39分。Llama-3.1-8B相比Llama-3.3-70B提高了0.66分 （p=0.0001，d=0.225），且模型在不同平台间表现出一致性；Llama-3.3-70B的安全性能有8%的失败案例，并且容易出现癫痫的误诊（33%）；进一步发现，谦虚表达与高安全性间存在相关性。研究表明，安全性主要取决于模型对齐与架构，而非规模。

Conclusion: 结论指出，模型的规模并不总是决定其安全性的关键因素，反而一些较小的模型（如Llama-3.1-8B）在对抗性环境中表现更好，这表明通过更有针对性的训练来提高模型的稳健性。然而，模型还存在不足之处，例如缺乏对危机情况的识别能力，这使得模型在紧急情况下的应用面临限制。研究结果强调了对抗测试的重要性，同时也为医疗AI安全性提供了一个开放基准。

Abstract: Background Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in medical consultations, yet their safety under realistic user pressures remains understudied. Prior assessments focused on neutral conditions, overlooking vulnerabilities from anxious users challenging safeguards. This study evaluated LLM safety under parental anxiety-driven adversarial pressures in pediatric consultations across models and platforms. Methods PediatricAnxietyBench, from a prior evaluation, includes 300 queries (150 authentic, 150 adversarial) spanning 10 topics. Three models were assessed via APIs: Llama-3.3-70B and Llama-3.1-8B (Groq), Mistral-7B (HuggingFace), yielding 900 responses. Safety used a 0-15 scale for restraint, referral, hedging, emergency recognition, and non-prescriptive behavior. Analyses employed paired t-tests with bootstrapped CIs. Results Mean scores: 9.70 (Llama-3.3-70B) to 10.39 (Mistral-7B). Llama-3.1-8B outperformed Llama-3.3-70B by +0.66 (p=0.0001, d=0.225). Models showed positive adversarial effects, Mistral-7B strongest (+1.09, p=0.0002). Safety generalized across platforms; Llama-3.3-70B had 8% failures. Seizures vulnerable (33% inappropriate diagnoses). Hedging predicted safety (r=0.68, p<0.001). Conclusions Evaluation shows safety depends on alignment and architecture over scale, with smaller models outperforming larger. Evolution to robustness across releases suggests targeted training progress. Vulnerabilities and no emergency recognition indicate unsuitability for triage. Findings guide selection, stress adversarial testing, and provide open benchmark for medical AI safety.

Conclusion: 通过使用多语言预训练模型和Teacher-Student架构，能够有效解决标注资源不足的问题并在小模型中获得不错的性能，为医学文本分类提供了一种更高效的替代方案。

Abstract: In this work, we present an annotation framework that demonstrates how a multilingual LLM pretrained on a large corpus can be used as a teacher model to distill the expert knowledge needed for tagging medical texts in Polish. This work is part of a larger project called ADMEDVOICE, within which we collected an extensive corpus of medical texts representing five clinical categories - Radiology, Oncology, Cardiology, Hypertension, and Pathology. Using this data, we had to develop a multi-class classifier, but the fundamental problem turned out to be the lack of resources for annotating an adequate number of texts. Therefore, in our solution, we used the multilingual Llama3.1 model to annotate an extensive corpus of medical texts in Polish. Using our limited annotation resources, we verified only a portion of these labels, creating a test set from them. The data annotated in this way were then used for training and validation of 3 different types of classifiers based on the BERT architecture - the distilled DistilBERT model, BioBERT fine-tuned on medical data, and HerBERT fine-tuned on the Polish language corpus. Among the models we trained, the DistilBERT model achieved the best results, reaching an F1 score > 0.80 for each clinical category and an F1 score > 0.93 for 3 of them. In this way, we obtained a series of highly effective classifiers that represent an alternative to large language models, due to their nearly 500 times smaller size, 300 times lower GPU VRAM consumption, and several hundred times faster inference.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress, but understanding long and complex documents remains challenging. Many long-context benchmarks have been proposed, but they face several limitations, including task realism, data scalability, and data quality. To this end, we introduce SagaScale, a realistic, scalable, and high-quality long-context benchmark built from full-length novels. The entire benchmark is constructed using an automated data collection pipeline that utilizes external resources (e.g., Wikipedia pages) to curate question-answer pairs. Critically, these external resources are provided only for benchmark construction and not during evaluation, which allows LLMs to curate complex questions that go beyond what they can answer during evaluation. SagaScale is also bilingual and offers the largest context length to date, with average token counts exceeding 250K for English novels and 320K for Chinese novels. Our evaluation across 12 frontier LLMs and three long-context methods -- Naïve RAG, Agentic RAG, and Long Context -- yields key insights, including: (1) Directly supplying the full context to the LLM can outperform other methods by a large margin; (2) Most LLMs still struggle with lengthy contexts, but Gemini-2.5-Pro stands out as an exception; and (3) Agentic RAG effectively addresses the retrieval bottleneck in Naïve RAG. Finally, we publicly release the SagaScale benchmark and our data collection codebase to facilitate future research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in consequential decision-making settings, yet their robustness to benign prompt variation remains underexplored. In this work, we study whether LLMs maintain consistent ethical judgments across logically equivalent but syntactically different prompts, focusing on variations involving negation and conditional structure. We introduce Syntactic Framing Fragility (SFF), a robustness evaluation framework that isolates purely syntactic effects via Logical Polarity Normalization (LPN), enabling direct comparison of decisions across positive and negative framings without semantic drift. Auditing 23 state-of-the-art models spanning the U.S. and China as well as small U.S. open-source software models over 14 ethical scenarios and four controlled framings (39,975 decisions), we find widespread and statistically significant inconsistency: many models reverse ethical endorsements solely due to syntactic polarity, with open-source models exhibiting over twice the fragility of commercial counterparts. We further uncover extreme negation sensitivity, where some models endorse actions in 80-97% of cases when explicitly prompted with "should not." We show that eliciting chain-of-thought reasoning substantially reduces fragility, identifying a practical mitigation lever, and we map fragility across scenarios, finding higher risk in financial and business contexts than in medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that syntactic consistency constitutes a distinct and critical dimension of ethical robustness, and we argue that SFF-style audits should be a standard component of safety evaluation for deployed LLMs. Code and results will be available on github.com.

Abstract: Punctuation plays a critical role in resolving semantic and structural ambiguity in written language. Machine Translation (MT) systems are now widely applied across diverse domains and languages, including many low-resource settings. In this work, we focus on Marathi, a low- to middle-resource language. We introduce Virām, the first diagnostic benchmark for assessing punctuation robustness in English-to-Marathi machine translation, consisting of 54 manually curated, punctuation-ambiguous instances. We evaluate two primary strategies for enhancing reliability: a pipeline-based restore-then-translate approach and direct fine-tuned on punctuation-varied data. Our results demonstrate that specialized fine-tuned models and pipeline systems significantly improve translation quality over standard baselines on the Virām benchmark. Qualitative analysis reveals that the original model may result in wrong translations leading to wrong interpretations, while fine-tuned models significantly improve overall reliability. Furthermore, we find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) lag behind these task-specific approaches in preserving meaning for punctuation-ambiguous text, thus necessitating further research in this area.

Motivation: 研究发现LLMs在推理过程中存在系统性遗忘过去信息的现象，传统的评估方式可能低估了这种遗忘行为的功能性价值。

Method: 通过引入一种基于指数衰减的推断模型，利用一种新的基准测试套件评估LLMs在时间推理、概念漂移适应和关联回忆中的表现，从而构建一种轻量级的遗忘机制提示策略来改进长期推理性能。

Conclusion: 本文认为遗忘不应被视为LLMs的失效模式，而是一种指导适应性智能原理机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often evaluated against ideals of perfect Bayesian inference, yet growing evidence suggests that their in-context reasoning exhibits systematic forgetting of past information. Rather than viewing this behavior as a limitation, we reinterpret forgetting as a functional cognitive mechanism. Drawing inspiration from human memory dynamics, we model LLM inference as a probabilistic memory process governed by exponential decay. We introduce a benchmark suite that evaluates temporal reasoning, concept drift adaptation, and associative recall, enabling direct comparison between model behavior and human cognitive patterns. Our empirical results reveal that LLMs demonstrate forgetting rates analogous to human memory efficiency trade-offs between stability and adaptability. Building on these observations, we propose probabilistic memory prompting, a lightweight strategy that shapes evidence integration to mimic human-like memory decay, leading to improved long-horizon reasoning performance. Our findings position forgetting not as a failure mode, but as a principled mechanism for adaptive intelligence.

Conclusion: 研究提供了目前图-大语言模型整合在科学研究中的能力和极限的系统行为表征。

Abstract: Cross-domain scientific synthesis requires connecting mechanistic explanations across fragmented literature, a capability that remains challenging for both retrieval-based systems and unconstrained language models. While recent work has applied large language models to scientific summarization and question answering, these approaches provide limited control over reasoning depth and structural grounding. We frame mechanistic synthesis as a graph-constrained multi-hop reasoning problem over literature-derived concept graphs. Given a scientific query and a compact, query-local corpus, SciNets constructs a directed concept graph and synthesizes mechanistic explanations by identifying multi-hop reasoning paths that connect concepts that rarely co-occur within individual papers. We systematically compare shortest-path reasoning, k-shortest paths with diversity constraints, stochastic random walks, and a retrieval-augmented language model baseline. Rather than evaluating correctness, which is often indeterminate when synthesizing connections across distributed sources, we introduce a behavioral framework that measures symbolic reasoning depth, mechanistic diversity, and grounding stability. Across machine learning, biology, and climate science tasks, explicit graph constraints enable controllable multi-hop reasoning while revealing a consistent trade-off: deeper and more diverse symbolic reasoning increases grounding instability, whereas shortest-path reasoning remains highly stable but structurally conservative. These findings provide a systematic behavioral characterization of the limits and capabilities of current graph-LLM integration for scientific synthesis.

Abstract: Financial reports and earnings communications contain large volumes of structured and semi structured information, making detailed manual analysis inefficient. Earnings conference calls provide valuable evidence about a firm's performance, outlook, and strategic priorities. The manual analysis of lengthy call transcripts requires substantial effort and is susceptible to interpretive bias and unintentional error. In this work, we present a hybrid summarization framework that combines extractive and abstractive techniques to produce concise and factually reliable Reuters-style summaries from the ECTSum dataset. The proposed two stage pipeline first applies the LexRank algorithm to identify salient sentences, which are subsequently summarized using fine-tuned variants of BART and PEGASUS designed for resource constrained settings. In parallel, we fine-tune a Longformer Encoder-Decoder (LED) model to directly capture long-range contextual dependencies in financial documents.
  Model performance is evaluated using standard automatic metrics, including ROUGE, METEOR, MoverScore, and BERTScore, along with domain-specific variants such as SciBERTScore and FinBERTScore. To assess factual accuracy, we further employ entity-level measures based on source-precision and F1-target. The results highlight complementary trade offs between approaches, long context models yield the strongest overall performance, while the hybrid framework achieves competitive results with improved factual consistency under computational constraints. These findings support the development of practical summarization systems for efficiently distilling lengthy financial texts into usable business insights.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce a multi-level analysis framework for examining semantic geometry in multilingual embeddings, implemented through Semanscope (a visualization tool that applies PHATE manifold learning across four linguistic levels). Analysis of diverse datasets spanning sub-character components, alphabetic systems, semantic domains, and numerical concepts reveals systematic geometric patterns and critical limitations in current embedding models. At the sub-character level, purely structural elements (Chinese radicals) exhibit geometric collapse, highlighting model failures to distinguish semantic from structural components. At the character level, different writing systems show distinct geometric signatures. At the word level, content words form clustering-branching patterns across 20 semantic domains in English, Chinese, and German. Arabic numbers organize through spiral trajectories rather than clustering, violating standard distributional semantics assumptions. These findings establish PHATE manifold learning as an essential analytic tool not only for studying geometric structure of meaning in embedding space, but also for validating the effectiveness of embedding models in capturing semantic relationships.

Abstract: With hundreds of multilingual embedding models available, practitioners lack clear guidance on which provide genuine cross-lingual semantic alignment versus task performance through language-specific patterns. Task-driven benchmarks (MTEB) may mask fundamental alignment shortcomings. We introduce Semantic Affinity (SA), a bounded (between 0 and 1) metric measuring inter-lingual to intra-lingual spread ratio using cosine distance, combined with PHATE visualization in our Semanscope framework. Benchmarking 13 models across 4 datasets (52 experiments) reveals a three-tier structure: (1) Top BERT models (LaBSE SA = 0.70, USE SA = 0.68, S-BERT SA = 0.68) achieve strong alignment via translation-pair supervision; (2) LLM embeddings plateau at SA between 0.55 and 0.61 regardless of 0.6 B to 8 B scale; (3) MLM-only BERT models (mBERT, XLM-R, SA < 0.50) fail despite more than 100 language training. Training objective, not architecture or scale, determines alignment. Oracle Bone primitives (1200 BCE) expose semantic drift-models learn corpus patterns rather than cognitive primitives. This work provides semantic benchmarking to help practitioners select quality multilingual embeddings from hundreds of available models, showing cross-lingual alignment requires explicit translation supervision, not merely model scale or multilingual data.

Abstract: The construction of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) datasets is a critical yet under-theorized stage in the post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs), as prevalent practices often rely on heuristic aggregation without a systematic understanding of how individual samples contribute to model performance. In this report, we propose a paradigm shift from ad-hoc curation to a closed-loop dataset engineering framework using OpenDataArena (ODA), which leverages value-anchored rankings and multi-dimensional analysis to transform value benchmarking into feedback signals guiding dataset construction. We instantiate this methodology through two new datasets: \textbf{ODA-Math-460k}, a specialized mathematics reasoning dataset that utilizes a novel two-stage difficulty-aware pipeline to achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) results on benchmarks such as AIME and HMMT, and \textbf{ODA-Mixture (100k \& 500k)}, a series of multi-domain instruction datasets built via an ``Anchor-and-Patch'' strategy that outperforms significantly larger open-source baselines. Our empirical results demonstrate that ODA-driven datasets significantly improve both domain-specific reasoning and general utility while achieving superior data efficiency, validating a transition toward data-centric AI where transparent evaluation serves as the primary engine for engineering high-quality training data.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), defined as the generation of content inconsistent with facts or context, represent a core obstacle to their reliable deployment in critical domains. Current research primarily focuses on binary "detection" approaches that, while capable of identifying hallucinations, fail to provide interpretable and actionable feedback for model improvement, thus limiting practical utility. To address this limitation, a new research paradigm is proposed, shifting from "detection" to "diagnosis". The Hallucination Diagnosis Task is introduced, a task which requires models to not only detect hallucinations, but also perform error localization, causal explanation, and content correction. We develop the Hallucination Diagnosis Generator (HDG), an automated pipeline that systematically generates high-quality training samples with rich diagnostic metadata from raw corpora through multi-dimensional augmentation strategies including controlled fact fabrication and reasoning chain perturbation. Using HDG-generated data, we train HDM-4B-RL, a 4-billion-parameter hallucination diagnosis model, employing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a comprehensive reward function incorporating structural, accuracy, and localization signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses previous state-of-the-art detection models on the HaluEval benchmark while achieving comparable performance to advanced general-purpose models. In comprehensive diagnosis tasks, HDM-4B-RL matches the capabilities of larger general models while maintaining a smaller size. This work validates the feasibility and value of hallucination diagnosis, providing an effective methodology for building more trustworthy and reliable generative AI systems.

Motivation: 现有的基于问卷的评估方法稳定性较差且不够透明，PVNI旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过使用对比提示从模型内部激活中提取与目标性格特征相关的persona向量，并通过 persona 向量进行中立评分的插值，从而获得可解释的中性评分。

Result: 在各种大型语言模型上进行的大量实验表明，PVNI的评估结果比现有方法更加稳定。

Conclusion: PVNI提供了一种新的、更稳定和可解释的方法来评估大型语言模型的性格特征，有助于模型的理解、比较及其负责任的部署。

Abstract: Evaluating personality traits in Large Language Models (LLMs) is key to model interpretation, comparison, and responsible deployment. However, existing questionnaire-based evaluation methods exhibit limited stability and offer little explainability, as their results are highly sensitive to minor variations in prompt phrasing or role-play configurations. To address these limitations, we propose an internal-activation-based approach, termed Persona-Vector Neutrality Interpolation (PVNI), for stable and explainable personality trait evaluation in LLMs. PVNI extracts a persona vector associated with a target personality trait from the model's internal activations using contrastive prompts. It then estimates the corresponding neutral score by interpolating along the persona vector as an anchor axis, enabling an interpretable comparison between the neutral prompt representation and the persona direction. We provide a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness and generalization properties of PVNI. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs demonstrate that PVNI yields substantially more stable personality trait evaluations than existing methods, even under questionnaire and role-play variants.

Motivation: 探讨语言如何影响我们在归纳推理中的方式。

Method: 使用Vision语言模型完成一系列预条件测试和原始实验，分析其表示方法。

Result: 模型在任务上的表现与人类行为一致，表明不同陈述结构对归纳推理的影响与人类类似。

Conclusion: 模型的差异组织遵循归纳约束而非表面形式差异。

Abstract: Language places subtle constraints on how we make inductive inferences. Developmental evidence by Gelman et al. (2002) has shown children (4 years and older) to differentiate among generic statements ("Bears are daxable"), universally quantified NPs ("all bears are daxable") and indefinite plural NPs ("some bears are daxable") in extending novel properties to a specific member (all > generics > some), suggesting that they represent these types of propositions differently. We test if these subtle differences arise in general purpose statistical learners like Vision Language Models, by replicating the original experiment. On tasking them through a series of precondition tests (robust identification of categories in images and sensitivities to all and some), followed by the original experiment, we find behavioral alignment between models and humans. Post-hoc analyses on their representations revealed that these differences are organized based on inductive constraints and not surface-form differences.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在医疗咨询中的应用日益广泛，研究者发现这些模型尚未被测试其在应对错误假设的医疗建议请求的能力，因此他们开发了一个数据集来系统评估不同模型的表现。

Method: 研究团队创建了一个半自动化管道，从Reddit收集了大量需要重新导向的问题，形成MedRedFlag数据集。然后使用最新的大型语言模型与临床医生的回应进行了系统对比。

Result: 结果显示，大型语言模型在识别错误前提后未能正确重新导向问题，且给出的答案可能导致医疗决策不当，表明这些模型在现实医疗沟通场景中的表现存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了患者接触型医疗AI系统面临的重要安全隐患，强调了改进这些模型以应对复杂医疗沟通情景的重要性。

Abstract: Real-world health questions from patients often unintentionally embed false assumptions or premises. In such cases, safe medical communication typically involves redirection: addressing the implicit misconception and then responding to the underlying patient context, rather than the original question. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used by lay users for medical advice, they have not yet been tested for this crucial competency. Therefore, in this work, we investigate how LLMs react to false premises embedded within real-world health questions. We develop a semi-automated pipeline to curate MedRedFlag, a dataset of 1100+ questions sourced from Reddit that require redirection. We then systematically compare responses from state-of-the-art LLMs to those from clinicians. Our analysis reveals that LLMs often fail to redirect problematic questions, even when the problematic premise is detected, and provide answers that could lead to suboptimal medical decision making. Our benchmark and results reveal a novel and substantial gap in how LLMs perform under the conditions of real-world health communication, highlighting critical safety concerns for patient-facing medical AI systems.

Abstract: Scientific paper generation requires document-level planning and factual grounding, but current large language models, despite their strong local fluency, often fail in global structure, input coverage, and citation consistency. We present a reinforcement learning framework that casts scientific outline construction as a long-horizon planning problem over hierarchical document structures. Our approach models edit evolving outlines through structured actions, enabling the system to incrementally build a complete scientific manuscript. To support effective and stabilize learning,we introduce a two-stage optimization procedure consisting of (i) backward outline reconstruction from partial plans to enforce global structural consistency, and (ii) forward value-guided reinforcement learning with rewards explicitly modeling scientific correctness, discourse coherence, and citation fidelity. In addition, We further introduce a benchmark for scientific paper generation that evaluates document planning, input utilization, reference faithfulness, outline organization, and content-level factual accuracy. Our results show consistent improvements over strong neural and LLM baselines, particularly in long-range structural coherence and citation reliability.

Abstract: Real-world clinical text-to-SQL requires reasoning over heterogeneous EHR tables, temporal windows, and patient-similarity cohorts to produce executable queries. We introduce CLINSQL, a benchmark of 633 expert-annotated tasks on MIMIC-IV v3.1 that demands multi-table joins, clinically meaningful filters, and executable SQL. Solving CLINSQL entails navigating schema metadata and clinical coding systems, handling long contexts, and composing multi-step queries beyond traditional text-to-SQL. We evaluate 22 proprietary and open-source models under Chain-of-Thought self-refinement and use rubric-based SQL analysis with execution checks that prioritize critical clinical requirements. Despite recent advances, performance remains far from clinical reliability: on the test set, GPT-5-mini attains 74.7% execution score, DeepSeek-R1 leads open-source at 69.2% and Gemini-2.5-Pro drops from 85.5% on Easy to 67.2% on Hard. Progress on CLINSQL marks tangible advances toward clinically reliable text-to-SQL for real-world EHR analytics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: How predictable a word is can be quantified in two ways: using human responses to the cloze task or using probabilities from language models (LMs).When used as predictors of processing effort, LM probabilities outperform probabilities derived from cloze data. However, it is important to establish that LM probabilities do so for the right reasons, since different predictors can lead to different scientific conclusions about the role of prediction in language comprehension. We present evidence for three hypotheses about the advantage of LM probabilities: not suffering from low resolution, distinguishing semantically similar words, and accurately assigning probabilities to low-frequency words. These results call for efforts to improve the resolution of cloze studies, coupled with experiments on whether human-like prediction is also as sensitive to the fine-grained distinctions made by LM probabilities.

Abstract: Standardized math assessments require expensive human pilot studies to establish the difficulty of test items. We investigate the predictive value of open-source large language models (LLMs) for evaluating the difficulty of multiple-choice math questions for real-world students. We show that, while LLMs are poor direct judges of problem difficulty, simulation-based approaches with LLMs yield promising results under the right conditions. Under the proposed approach, we simulate a "classroom" of 4th, 8th, or 12th grade students by prompting the LLM to role-play students of varying proficiency levels. We use the outcomes of these simulations to fit Item Response Theory (IRT) models, comparing learned difficulty parameters for items to their real-world difficulties, as determined by item-level statistics furnished by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). We observe correlations as high as 0.75, 0.76, and 0.82 for grades 4, 8, and 12, respectively. In our simulations, we experiment with different "classroom sizes," showing tradeoffs between computation size and accuracy. We find that role-plays with named students improves predictions (compared to student ids), and stratifying names across gender and race further improves predictions. Our results show that LLMs with relatively weaker mathematical abilities (Gemma) actually yield better real-world difficulty predictions than mathematically stronger models (Llama and Qwen), further underscoring the suitability of open-source models for the task.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for low-resource languages suffer significant performance degradation under domain shift. We quantify this challenge using Dhao, an indigenous language of Eastern Indonesia with no digital footprint beyond the New Testament (NT). When applied to the unseen Old Testament (OT), a standard NMT model fine-tuned on the NT drops from an in-domain score of 36.17 chrF++ to 27.11 chrF++. To recover this loss, we introduce a hybrid framework where a fine-tuned NMT model generates an initial draft, which is then refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The final system achieves 35.21 chrF++ (+8.10 recovery), effectively matching the original in-domain quality. Our analysis reveals that this performance is driven primarily by the number of retrieved examples rather than the choice of retrieval algorithm. Qualitative analysis confirms the LLM acts as a robust "safety net," repairing severe failures in zero-shot domains.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Constructing Knowledge Graphs (KGs) from unstructured text provides a structured framework for knowledge representation and reasoning, yet current LLM-based approaches struggle with a fundamental trade-off: factual coverage often leads to relational fragmentation, while premature consolidation causes information loss. To address this, we propose SocraticKG, an automated KG construction method that introduces question-answer pairs as a structured intermediate representation to systematically unfold document-level semantics prior to triple extraction. By employing 5W1H-guided QA expansion, SocraticKG captures contextual dependencies and implicit relational links typically lost in direct KG extraction pipelines, providing explicit grounding in the source document that helps mitigate implicit reasoning errors. Evaluation on the MINE benchmark demonstrates that our approach effectively addresses the coverage-connectivity trade-off, achieving superior factual retention while maintaining high structural cohesion even as extracted knowledge volume substantially expands. These results highlight that QA-mediated semantic scaffolding plays a critical role in structuring semantics prior to KG extraction, enabling more coherent and reliable graph construction in subsequent stages.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making increasingly relies on timely and context-aware access to patient information within Electronic Health Records (EHRs), yet most existing natural language question-answering (QA) systems are evaluated solely on benchmark datasets, limiting their practical relevance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce EHRNavigator, a multi-agent framework that harnesses AI agents to perform patient-level question answering across heterogeneous and multimodal EHR data. We assessed its performance using both public benchmark and institutional datasets under realistic hospital conditions characterized by diverse schemas, temporal reasoning demands, and multimodal evidence integration. Through quantitative evaluation and clinician-validated chart review, EHRNavigator demonstrated strong generalization, achieving 86% accuracy on real-world cases while maintaining clinically acceptable response times. Overall, these findings confirm that EHRNavigator effectively bridges the gap between benchmark evaluation and clinical deployment, offering a robust, adaptive, and efficient solution for real-world EHR question answering.

Abstract: This paper introduces EmplifAI, a Japanese empathetic dialogue dataset designed to support patients coping with chronic medical conditions. They often experience a wide range of positive and negative emotions (e.g., hope and despair) that shift across different stages of disease management. EmplifAI addresses this complexity by providing situation-based dialogues grounded in 28 fine-grained emotion categories, adapted and validated from the GoEmotions taxonomy. The dataset includes 280 medically contextualized situations and 4125 two-turn dialogues, collected through crowdsourcing and expert review. To evaluate emotional alignment in empathetic dialogues, we assessed model predictions on situation--dialogue pairs using BERTScore across multiple large language models (LLMs), achieving F1 scores of 0.83. Fine-tuning a baseline Japanese LLM (LLM-jp-3.1-13b-instruct4) with EmplifAI resulted in notable improvements in fluency, general empathy, and emotion-specific empathy. Furthermore, we compared the scores assigned by LLM-as-a-Judge and human raters on dialogues generated by multiple LLMs to validate our evaluation pipeline and discuss the insights and potential risks derived from the correlation analysis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, particularly in solving complex mathematical problems. Recent studies show that distilling long reasoning trajectories can effectively enhance the reasoning performance of small-scale student models. However, teacher-generated reasoning trajectories are often excessively long and structurally complex, making them difficult for student models to learn. This mismatch leads to a gap between the provided supervision signal and the learning capacity of the student model. To address this challenge, we propose Prefix-ALIGNment distillation (P-ALIGN), a framework that fully exploits teacher CoTs for distillation through adaptive prefix alignment. Specifically, P-ALIGN adaptively truncates teacher-generated reasoning trajectories by determining whether the remaining suffix is concise and sufficient to guide the student model. Then, P-ALIGN leverages the teacher-generated prefix to supervise the student model, encouraging effective prefix alignment. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that P-ALIGN outperforms all baselines by over 3%. Further analysis indicates that the prefixes constructed by P-ALIGN provide more effective supervision signals, while avoiding the negative impact of redundant and uncertain reasoning components. All code is available at https://github.com/NEUIR/P-ALIGN.

Commercial MT systems are reasonable tools to turn to in these scenarios. But how effective are these tools for translating to and from low resource languages, particularly in the crisis or medical domain? In this study, we evaluate four commercial MT systems using the TICO-19 dataset, which is composed of pandemic-related sentences from a large set of high priority languages spoken by communities most likely to be affected adversely in the next pandemic. We then assess the current degree of ``readiness'' for another pandemic (or epidemic) based on the usability of the output translations.

Motivation: 当前的大语言模型（LLMs）虽然可以生成流畅的回应，但在长时间的对话中无法维持连贯且目标导向的交流，导致表现不稳定和目标偏离。为了解决这个问题，作者提出了CALM-IT框架。

Method: CALM-IT框架采用双向状态空间模型来表示咨询师与患者之间的互动，双方不断更新对方的心理状态和短期目标，以指导策略选择和语言生成。

Result: 在大规模评估中，CALM-IT在效果和目标一致性方面超过了强大的基线，且随着对话长度的增加，稳定性显著提高。接受咨询师引导的次数减少，但保持了较高的用户接受度（64.3%）。

Conclusion: 研究证明，建模对话的进化状态对于生成高质量、长时间的合成对话至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in mental health-related settings, yet they struggle to sustain realistic, goal-directed dialogue over extended interactions. While LLMs generate fluent responses, they optimize locally for the next turn rather than maintaining a coherent model of therapeutic progress, leading to brittleness and long-horizon drift. We introduce CALM-IT, a framework for generating and evaluating long-form Motivational Interviewing (MI) dialogues that explicitly models dual-actor conversational dynamics. CALM-IT represents therapist-client interaction as a bidirectional state-space process, in which both agents continuously update inferred alignment, mental states, and short-term goals to guide strategy selection and utterance generation. Across large-scale evaluations, CALM-IT consistently outperforms strong baselines in Effectiveness and Goal Alignment and remains substantially more stable as conversation length increases. Although CALM-IT initiates fewer therapist redirections, it achieves the highest client acceptance rate (64.3%), indicating more precise and therapeutically aligned intervention timing. Overall, CALM-IT provides evidence for modeling evolving conversational state being essential for generating high-quality long-form synthetic conversations.

Abstract: Evaluating whether multimodal large language models truly understand long-form scientific papers remains challenging: answer-only metrics and synthetic "Needle-In-A-Haystack" tests often reward answer matching without requiring a causal, evidence-linked reasoning trace in the document. We propose the "Fish-in-the-Ocean" (FITO) paradigm, which requires models to construct explicit cross-modal evidence chains within native scientific documents. To operationalize FITO, we build SIN-Data, a scientific interleaved corpus that preserves the native interleaving of text and figures. On top of it, we construct SIN-Bench with four progressive tasks covering evidence discovery (SIN-Find), hypothesis verification (SIN-Verify), grounded QA (SIN-QA), and evidence-anchored synthesis (SIN-Summary). We further introduce "No Evidence, No Score", scoring predictions when grounded to verifiable anchors and diagnosing evidence quality via matching, relevance, and logic. Experiments on eight MLLMs show that grounding is the primary bottleneck: Gemini-3-pro achieves the best average overall score (0.573), while GPT-5 attains the highest SIN-QA answer accuracy (0.767) but underperforms on evidence-aligned overall scores, exposing a gap between correctness and traceable support.

Abstract: Large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 and their distilled variants achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, distilling these models often demands large-scale data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), motivating the pursuit of data-efficient training methods. To address this, we propose a skill-centric distillation framework that efficiently transfers reasoning ability to weaker models with two components: (1) Skill-based data selection, which prioritizes examples targeting the student model's weaker skills, and (2) Skill-aware fine-tuning, which encourages explicit skill decomposition during problem solving. With only 1,000 training examples selected from a 100K teacher-generated corpus, our method surpasses random SFT baselines by +1.6% on Qwen3-4B and +1.4% on Qwen3-8B across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Further analysis confirms that these gains concentrate on skills emphasized during training, highlighting the effectiveness of skill-centric training for efficient reasoning distillation.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), role-playing language agents (RPLAs) have emerged as a prominent research focus at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and human-computer interaction. This paper systematically reviews the current development and key technologies of RPLAs, delineating the technological evolution from early rule-based template paradigms, through the language style imitation stage, to the cognitive simulation stage centered on personality modeling and memory mechanisms. It summarizes the critical technical pathways supporting high-quality role-playing, including psychological scale-driven character modeling, memory-augmented prompting mechanisms, and motivation-situation-based behavioral decision control. At the data level, the paper further analyzes the methods and challenges of constructing role-specific corpora, focusing on data sources, copyright constraints, and structured annotation processes. In terms of evaluation, it collates multi-dimensional assessment frameworks and benchmark datasets covering role knowledge, personality fidelity, value alignment, and interactive hallucination, while commenting on the advantages and disadvantages of methods such as human evaluation, reward models, and LLM-based scoring. Finally, the paper outlines future development directions of role-playing agents, including personality evolution modeling, multi-agent collaborative narrative, multimodal immersive interaction, and integration with cognitive neuroscience, aiming to provide a systematic perspective and methodological insights for subsequent research.

Abstract: While LLM-based agents can interact with environments via invoking external tools, their expanded capabilities also amplify security risks. Monitoring step-level tool invocation behaviors in real time and proactively intervening before unsafe execution is critical for agent deployment, yet remains under-explored. In this work, we first construct TS-Bench, a novel benchmark for step-level tool invocation safety detection in LLM agents. We then develop a guardrail model, TS-Guard, using multi-task reinforcement learning. The model proactively detects unsafe tool invocation actions before execution by reasoning over the interaction history. It assesses request harmfulness and action-attack correlations, producing interpretable and generalizable safety judgments and feedback. Furthermore, we introduce TS-Flow, a guardrail-feedback-driven reasoning framework for LLM agents, which reduces harmful tool invocations of ReAct-style agents by 65 percent on average and improves benign task completion by approximately 10 percent under prompt injection attacks.

Abstract: Most interpretability work focuses on layer- or neuron-level mechanisms in Transformers, leaving expert-level behavior in MoE LLMs underexplored. Motivated by functional specialization in the human brain, we analyze expert activation by distinguishing domain and driver experts. In this work, we study expert activation in MoE models across three public domains and address two key questions: (1) which experts are activated, and whether certain expert types exhibit consistent activation patterns; and (2) how tokens are associated with and trigger the activation of specific experts. To answer these questions, we introduce entropy-based and causal-effect metrics to assess whether an expert is strongly favored for a particular domain, and how strongly expert activation contributes causally to the model's output, thus identify domain and driver experts, respectively. Furthermore, we explore how individual tokens are associated with the activation of specific experts. Our analysis reveals that (1) Among the activated experts, some show clear domain preferences, while others exert strong causal influence on model performance, underscoring their decisive roles. (2) tokens occurring earlier in a sentence are more likely to trigger the driver experts, and (3) adjusting the weights of domain and driver experts leads to significant performance gains across all three models and domains. These findings shed light on the internal mechanisms of MoE models and enhance their interpretability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Pretraining corpora contain extensive discourse about AI systems, yet the causal influence of this discourse on downstream alignment remains poorly understood. If prevailing descriptions of AI behaviour are predominantly negative, LLMs may internalise corresponding behavioural priors, giving rise to self-fulfilling misalignment. This paper provides the first controlled study of this hypothesis by pretraining 6.9B-parameter LLMs with varying amounts of (mis)alignment discourse. We find that discussion of AI contributes to misalignment. Upsampling synthetic training documents about AI misalignment leads to a notable increase in misaligned behaviour. Conversely, upsampling documents about aligned behaviour reduces misalignment scores from 45% to 9%. We consider this evidence of self-fulfilling alignment. These effects are dampened, but persist through post-training. Our findings establish the study of how pretraining data shapes alignment priors, or alignment pretraining, as a complement to post-training. We recommend practitioners pretrain for alignment as well as capabilities. Our models and datasets are available at alignmentpretraining.ai

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Debt collection is a critical function within the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector, relying heavily on large-scale human-to-human conversational interactions conducted primarily in Vietnamese contact centers. These conversations involve informal spoken language, emotional variability, and complex domain-specific reasoning, which pose significant challenges for traditional natural language processing systems. This paper introduces Credit C-GPT, a domain-specialized large language model with seven billion parameters, fine-tuned for conversational understanding in Vietnamese debt collection scenarios. The proposed model integrates multiple conversational intelligence tasks, including dialogue understanding, sentiment recognition, intent detection, call stage classification, and structured slot-value extraction, within a single reasoning-based framework. We describe the data construction process, annotation strategy, and training methodology, and evaluate the model on proprietary human-annotated datasets. Experimental results show consistent improvements over traditional pipeline-based approaches, indicating that domain-specialized conversational language models provide a scalable and privacy-aware solution for real-time assistance and post-call analytics in enterprise contact centers.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable strides in multilingual translation but are hindered by a systemic cross-lingual verbosity bias, rendering them unsuitable for strict time-constrained tasks like subtitling and dubbing. Current prompt-engineering approaches struggle to resolve this conflict between semantic fidelity and rigid temporal feasibility. To bridge this gap, we first introduce Sand-Glass, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate translation under syllable-level duration constraints. Furthermore, we propose HOMURA, a reinforcement learning framework that explicitly optimizes the trade-off between semantic preservation and temporal compliance. By employing a KL-regularized objective with a novel dynamic syllable-ratio reward, HOMURA effectively "tames" the output length. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines, achieving precise length control that respects linguistic density hierarchies without compromising semantic adequacy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning and generation, serving as the foundation for advanced persona simulation and Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs). However, achieving authentic alignment with human cognitive and behavioral patterns remains a critical challenge for these agents. We present HUMANLLM, a framework treating psychological patterns as interacting causal forces. We construct 244 patterns from ~12,000 academic papers and synthesize 11,359 scenarios where 2-5 patterns reinforce, conflict, or modulate each other, with multi-turn conversations expressing inner thoughts, actions, and dialogue. Our dual-level checklists evaluate both individual pattern fidelity and emergent multi-pattern dynamics, achieving strong human alignment (r=0.91) while revealing that holistic metrics conflate simulation accuracy with social desirability. HUMANLLM-8B outperforms Qwen3-32B on multi-pattern dynamics despite 4x fewer parameters, demonstrating that authentic anthropomorphism requires cognitive modeling--simulating not just what humans do, but the psychological processes generating those behaviors.

Abstract: Aligning multilingual assistants with culturally grounded user preferences is essential for serving India's linguistically diverse population of over one billion speakers across multiple scripts. However, existing benchmarks either focus on a single language or conflate retrieval with generation, leaving open the question of whether current embedding models can encode persona-instruction compatibility without relying on response synthesis. We present a unified benchmark spanning 12 Indian languages and four evaluation tasks: monolingual and cross-lingual persona-to-instruction retrieval, reverse retrieval from instruction to persona, and binary compatibility classification. Eight multilingual embedding models are evaluated in a frozen-encoder setting with a thin logistic regression head for classification. E5-Large-Instruct achieves the highest Recall@1 of 27.4\% on monolingual retrieval and 20.7\% on cross-lingual transfer, while BGE-M3 leads reverse retrieval at 32.1\% Recall@1. For classification, LaBSE attains 75.3\% AUROC with strong calibration. These findings offer practical guidance for model selection in Indic multilingual retrieval and establish reproducible baselines for future work\footnote{Code, datasets, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/aryashah2k/PI-Indic-Align.

TL;DR: 研究通过实验发现，循环变换器（LTs）在增加循环迭代次数时能缩小内部知识与语言输出之间的差距，但这种效果部分归因于内部知识的退化。进一步分析表明，LTs 在循环过程中对表示的认知能力仅存在于最终循环中。这表明虽然LTs为扩展计算深度提供了有希望的方向，但尚未实现将表示空间与自然语言真正关联所需的反思。

Motivation: 研究旨在探索循环变换器（LTs）是否可以通过利用其迭代特性作为一种形式的自我反省来弥补大型语言模型（LLMs）在知识内部性和语言表现之间差距。

Method: 通过实验性方法，增加了循环变换器的循环迭代次数，并分析了其对内部知识和语言输出之间差距的影响。

Result: 实验结果显示，增加循环迭代次数可以缩小差距，但这种效果部分是由于内部知识表示的质量下降。进一步分析表明，当前的LTs在循环过程中对表示的认知能力仅限于最终循环。

Conclusion: 尽管循环变换器为提高计算深度提供了有希望的方法，但它们仍未达到将表示空间与自然语言真正关联所需的认知能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit a gap between their internal knowledge and their explicit linguistic outputs. In this report, we empirically investigate whether Looped Transformers (LTs)--architectures that increase computational depth by iterating shared layers--can bridge this gap by utilizing their iterative nature as a form of introspection. Our experiments reveal that while increasing loop iterations narrows the gap, it is partly driven by a degradation of their internal knowledge carried by representations. Moreover, another empirical analysis suggests that current LTs' ability to perceive representations does not improve across loops; it is only present in the final loop. These results suggest that while LTs offer a promising direction for scaling computational depth, they have yet to achieve the introspection required to truly link representation space and natural language.

Result: 研究结果显示推理语言的影响比输入语言的影响大；并且发现了标准评估忽视的指标依赖性。

Conclusion: 该方法具有诊断作用，可以指导LLM在实际应用场景中的部署。

Abstract: When LLMs judge moral dilemmas, do they reach different conclusions in different languages, and if so, why? Two factors could drive such differences: the language of the dilemma itself, or the language in which the model reasons. Standard evaluation conflates these by testing only matched conditions (e.g., English dilemma with English reasoning). We introduce a methodology that separately manipulates each factor, covering also mismatched conditions (e.g., English dilemma with Chinese reasoning), enabling decomposition of their contributions. To study \emph{what} changes, we propose an approach to interpret the moral judgments in terms of Moral Foundations Theory. As a side result, we identify evidence for splitting the Authority dimension into a family-related and an institutional dimension. Applying this methodology to English-Chinese moral judgment with 13 LLMs, we demonstrate its diagnostic power: (1) the framework isolates reasoning-language effects as contributing twice the variance of input-language effects; (2) it detects context-dependency in nearly half of models that standard evaluation misses; and (3) a diagnostic taxonomy translates these patterns into deployment guidance. We release our code and datasets at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CrossCulturalMoralJudgement.

Abstract: Understanding relationships between attention heads is essential for interpreting the internal structure of Transformers, yet existing metrics do not capture this structure well. We focus on the subspaces spanned by attention-head weight matrices and quantify head-to-head relationships using the Projection Kernel (PK), a principal-angle-based measure of subspace similarity. Experiments show that PK reproduces known head-to-head interactions on the IOI task more clearly than prior metrics such as the Composition Score. We further introduce a framework to quantify the informativeness of PK distributions by comparing them with a reference distribution derived from random orthogonal subspaces. As an application, we analyze a directed graph constructed from PK and show that, in GPT2-small, L4H7 acts as a hub by functioning as an identity head.

Abstract: We present MoST (Mixture of Speech and Text), a novel multimodal large language model that seamlessly integrates speech and text processing through our proposed Modality-Aware Mixture of Experts (MAMoE) architecture. While current multimodal models typically process diverse modality representations with identical parameters, disregarding their inherent representational differences, we introduce specialized routing pathways that direct tokens to modality-appropriate experts based on input type. MAMoE simultaneously enhances modality-specific learning and cross-modal understanding through two complementary components: modality-specific expert groups that capture domain-specific patterns and shared experts that facilitate information transfer between modalities. Building on this architecture, we develop an efficient transformation pipeline that adapts the pretrained MoE language model through strategic post-training on ASR and TTS datasets, followed by fine-tuning with a carefully curated speech-text instruction dataset. A key feature of this pipeline is that it relies exclusively on fully accessible, open-source datasets to achieve strong performance and data efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations across ASR, TTS, audio language modeling, and spoken question answering benchmarks show that MoST consistently outperforms existing models of comparable parameter counts. Our ablation studies confirm that the modality-specific routing mechanism and shared experts design significantly contribute to performance gains across all tested domains. To our knowledge, MoST represents the first fully open-source speech-text LLM built on a Mixture of Experts architecture. \footnote{We release MoST model, training code, inference code, and training data at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/MoST

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Enhancing the moral alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical challenge in AI safety. Current alignment techniques often act as superficial guardrails, leaving the intrinsic moral representations of LLMs largely untouched. In this paper, we bridge this gap by leveraging Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) to map and manipulate the fine-grained moral landscape of LLMs. Through cross-lingual linear probing, we validate the shared nature of moral representations in middle layers and uncover a shared yet different moral subspace between English and Chinese. Building upon this, we extract steerable Moral Vectors and successfully validate their efficacy at both internal and behavioral levels. Leveraging the high generalizability of morality, we propose Adaptive Moral Fusion (AMF), a dynamic inference-time intervention that synergizes probe detection with vector injection to tackle the safety-helpfulness trade-off. Empirical results confirm that our approach acts as a targeted intrinsic defense, effectively reducing incorrect refusals on benign queries while minimizing jailbreak success rates compared to standard baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法主要依靠共享参数和比例来完成多语言对齐，但这种方式可能无法充分捕捉不同语言之间的潜藏意义表示。为了解决这个问题，作者提出了SENSE-based Symmetric Interlingual Alignment (SENSIA)，该方法通过在平行数据上对齐词义层次和上下文表示来适应背包语言模型。

Method: SENSIA通过在一个语言的基础上进行平移，使用从关联数据中学习到的词义层次混合和上下文表示来对齐另一种语言，在联合训练目标语言语言模型损失的同时使得流畅性得到保留。

Result: SENSIA在四个不同类型的基准测试中，表现出优于其他多语言对齐方法的效果，且能在使用更少的目标语言数据时与从头开始训练的单语言基线达到竞争水平。

Conclusion: 通过证明其在保留流利性和减少语言资源需求上的优越性，实验证实了该方法的有效性，并且对学得的词义几何结构的分析显示了大量的词义局部结构和相对于英语的整体结构得到了保留，同时表明该方法在设计和规模上具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: We approach multilinguality as sense adaptation: aligning latent meaning representations across languages rather than relying solely on shared parameters and scale. In this paper, we introduce SENse-based Symmetric Interlingual Alignment (SENSIA), which adapts a Backpack language model from one language to another by explicitly aligning sense-level mixtures and contextual representations on parallel data, while jointly training a target-language language modeling loss to preserve fluency. Across benchmarks on four typologically diverse languages, SENSIA generally outperforms comparable multilingual alignment methods and achieves competitive accuracy against monolingual from-scratch baselines while using 2-4x less target-language data. Analyses of learned sense geometry indicate that local sense topology and global structure relative to English are largely preserved, and ablations show that the method is robust in terms of design and scale.

Abstract: In this paper, we present BAR-SQL (Boundary-Aware Reliable NL2SQL), a unified training framework that embeds reliability and boundary awareness directly into the generation process. We introduce a Seed Mutation data synthesis paradigm that constructs a representative enterprise corpus, explicitly encompassing multi-step analytical queries alongside boundary cases including ambiguity and schema limitations. To ensure interpretability, we employ Knowledge-Grounded Reasoning Synthesis, which produces Chain-of-Thought traces explicitly anchored in schema metadata and business rules. The model is trained through a two-stage process: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization. We design a Task-Conditioned Hybrid Reward mechanism that simultaneously optimizes SQL execution accuracy-leveraging Abstract Syntax Tree analysis and dense result matching-and semantic precision in abstention responses. To evaluate reliability alongside generation accuracy, we construct and release Ent-SQL-Bench, which jointly assesse SQL precision and boundary-aware abstention across ambiguous and unanswerable queries. Experimental results on this benchmark demonstrate that BAR-SQL achieves 91.48% average accuracy, outperforming leading proprietary models, including Claude 4.5 Sonnet and GPT-5, in both SQL generation quality and boundary-aware abstention capability.

Motivation: 针对连续蒸馏在学生模型已有较强推理能力时存在的问题，研究设计了一种新的训练策略来优化尚未学习的模型部分。

Method: 研究首先观察到一个训练现象：即使损失逐渐降低，某些性能指标也可能在瓶颈处迅速下降，之后逐渐恢复。接着发现了一种令牌级别的机制：信心分离为逐渐增加的仿效锚定令牌和在瓶颈后才开始学习的令牌。基于此，提出了基于训练轨迹的令牌选择方法（T3S）来重新构建训练目标，以清除尚未学习令牌的优化路径。

Result: 实验结果表明，与DeepSeek-R1相比，仅用几百个样本，Qwen3-8B在竞争推理基准上超过了DeepSeek-R1；Qwen3-32B接近Qwen3-235B；T3训练的LLaDA-2.0-Mini超过了其推理基准，成为16B规模无思考模型中的最佳性能。

Conclusion: 研究发现了一种新的方法（T3S）来解决连续蒸馏中的一些问题，并通过实验验证了该方法的有效性，展示出在多种深度学习模型中的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Efficient distillation is a key pathway for converting expensive reasoning capability into deployable efficiency, yet in the frontier regime where the student already has strong reasoning ability, naive continual distillation often yields limited gains or even degradation. We observe a characteristic training phenomenon: even as loss decreases monotonically, all performance metrics can drop sharply at almost the same bottleneck, before gradually recovering. We further uncover a token-level mechanism: confidence bifurcates into steadily increasing Imitation-Anchor Tokens that quickly anchor optimization and other yet-to-learn tokens whose confidence is suppressed until after the bottleneck. And the characteristic that these two types of tokens cannot coexist is the root cause of the failure in continual distillation. To this end, we propose Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection (T3S) to reconstruct the training objective at the token level, clearing the optimization path for yet-to-learn tokens. T3 yields consistent gains in both AR and dLLM settings: with only hundreds of examples, Qwen3-8B surpasses DeepSeek-R1 on competitive reasoning benchmarks, Qwen3-32B approaches Qwen3-235B, and T3-trained LLaDA-2.0-Mini exceeds its AR baseline, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all of 16B-scale no-think models.

Result: 发现了'助手轴'，即模型运作中的默认'助手'模式的程度。偏离'助手'方向会使其更倾向于其他实体身份，严重时则可能引发神秘、戏剧化的表达风格。此外，评估模型行为偏移预测'人格漂移'现象。

Conclusion: 模型在面对需要元认知或情感脆弱的用户时容易发生'人格漂移'，应通过限制激活范围保持模型稳定，并进一步探索更深入绑定模型到一致人格的训练和引导策略。

Abstract: Large language models can represent a variety of personas but typically default to a helpful Assistant identity cultivated during post-training. We investigate the structure of the space of model personas by extracting activation directions corresponding to diverse character archetypes. Across several different models, we find that the leading component of this persona space is an "Assistant Axis," which captures the extent to which a model is operating in its default Assistant mode. Steering towards the Assistant direction reinforces helpful and harmless behavior; steering away increases the model's tendency to identify as other entities. Moreover, steering away with more extreme values often induces a mystical, theatrical speaking style. We find this axis is also present in pre-trained models, where it primarily promotes helpful human archetypes like consultants and coaches and inhibits spiritual ones. Measuring deviations along the Assistant Axis predicts "persona drift," a phenomenon where models slip into exhibiting harmful or bizarre behaviors that are uncharacteristic of their typical persona. We find that persona drift is often driven by conversations demanding meta-reflection on the model's processes or featuring emotionally vulnerable users. We show that restricting activations to a fixed region along the Assistant Axis can stabilize model behavior in these scenarios -- and also in the face of adversarial persona-based jailbreaks. Our results suggest that post-training steers models toward a particular region of persona space but only loosely tethers them to it, motivating work on training and steering strategies that more deeply anchor models to a coherent persona.

### [116] [INDIC DIALECT: A Multi Task Benchmark to Evaluate and Translate in Indian Language Dialects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10388)
*Tarun Sharma,Manikandan Ravikiran,Sourava Kumar Behera,Pramit Bhattacharya,Arnab Bhattacharya,Rohit Saluja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究旨在解决印度地区低资源方言服务不足的问题，推出了INDIC-DIALECT语料库，包含13000个句对，覆盖11种方言和印地语/奥里亚语，并构建了多任务基准，结果显示预训练模型在分类任务上表现不佳，而混合AI模型在这项任务上取得较好的BLEU分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的NLP研究大多集中在标准化语言上，而印度的方言由于涉及众多且缺乏相应标准化的数据集，导致发展中缺失了大量基础工作，这不仅限制了语言技术的进步，也影响了这些地区的人们获得语言服务的机会。

Method: 研发团队通过进行了精细调整预训练模型的方法，以及结合规则构建混合AI模型等方式，对模型进行了训练和优化。

Result: 实验表明，基于印度语言训练的微调模型在方言分类任务上有显著提升。在方言到语言的机器翻译任务中，混合AI模型取得了最高的BLEU分数。而在语言到方言的机器翻译任务中，规则导向的方法表现最佳。

Conclusion: INDIC-DIALECT为有意识地关注印度地区低资源方言的NLP研究提供了新基准，并计划开源以促进相关领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Recent NLP advances focus primarily on standardized languages, leaving most low-resource dialects under-served especially in Indian scenarios. In India, the issue is particularly important: despite Hindi being the third most spoken language globally (over 600 million speakers), its numerous dialects remain underrepresented. The situation is similar for Odia, which has around 45 million speakers. While some datasets exist which contain standard Hindi and Odia languages, their regional dialects have almost no web presence. We introduce INDIC-DIALECT, a human-curated parallel corpus of 13k sentence pairs spanning 11 dialects and 2 languages: Hindi and Odia. Using this corpus, we construct a multi-task benchmark with three tasks: dialect classification, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and machine translation (MT). Our experiments show that LLMs like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 perform poorly on the classification task. While fine-tuned transformer based models pretrained on Indian languages substantially improve performance e.g., improving F1 from 19.6\% to 89.8\% on dialect classification. For dialect to language translation, we find that hybrid AI model achieves highest BLEU score of 61.32 compared to the baseline score of 23.36. Interestingly, due to complexity in generating dialect sentences, we observe that for language to dialect translation the ``rule-based followed by AI" approach achieves best BLEU score of 48.44 compared to the baseline score of 27.59. INDIC-DIALECT thus is a new benchmark for dialect-aware Indic NLP, and we plan to release it as open source to support further work on low-resource Indian dialects.

TL;DR: TF3-RO是一个专注于罗曼语族的端到端语言模型生成框架，涉及 tokenizer 训练，从零开始模型开发，以及罗曼语方言数据生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源不足且形态丰富的罗曼语如罗曼语中，还没有公开的端到端框架来统一 tokenizer 设计、预处理、预训练、压缩、评估和大规模合成数据生成。

Method: 使用包含300万英语童话故事的TF1以及扩展到罗曼语的TF2数据集，通过机器翻译构建了一个罗曼语 Curtis-Centric 的 BPE 和 Unigram tokenizer，使用长序列打包训练方式进行从零开始的模型预训练，并通过量化、结构化剪枝、和基于 logits 的知识蒸馏实现模型精简。

Result: 得到一个26.45M参数的学生模型，具有固定的嵌入，生成了三百万条原生罗曼语的童话数据。

Conclusion: TF3-RO 提供了一个可复制且语言学上稳固的框架，用于训练紧凑的罗曼语语言模型并生成大规模合成叙事语料库。

Abstract: Recent advances in synthetic data generation have shown that compact language models can be trained effectively when the underlying corpus is structurally controlled and linguistically coherent. However, for morphologically rich and computationally under-resourced languages such as Romanian, there is still no openly documented, end-to-end pipeline that unifies tokenizer design, preprocessing, pretraining, compression, evaluation, and large-scale synthetic data generation in a reproducible framework. Building on TF1, a three-million-story English fable dataset, and TF2, which extends TF1 through high-quality Romanian translations, we introduce TF3-RO, a Romanian-centric language modeling pipeline spanning tokenizer training, from-scratch model development, and Romanian-native dataset generation. TF3-RO constructs Romanian-specific BPE and Unigram tokenizers from a linguistically informed corpus to mitigate token inflation induced by Romanian morphology. Using long-sequence packed training, we pretrain a 51.65M-parameter LLaMA-style Transformer entirely from scratch. The model is subsequently optimized through quantization, structured pruning, and logit-based knowledge distillation, yielding a compact 26.45M-parameter student model with tied embeddings and strong deployment characteristics. Using this distilled model, TF3-RO generates three million Romanian-native synthetic fables via a controlled combinatorial prompting framework. Across all stages, the pipeline integrates a comprehensive evaluation suite combining intrinsic metrics, Romanian agreement probes, entity coherence, rule-based grammar checking, and LLM-based assessment. TF3-RO provides a reproducible and linguistically grounded framework for training compact Romanian language models and producing large-scale synthetic narrative corpora.

TL;DR: 该摘要指出，Futrell和Mahowald认为语言模型作为认知模型的观点并不成立，从 Marr 的三个层面上看，LMs 的表现不尽如人意。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者认为将语言模型（LMs）视为认知模型是夸大的说法，需要进一步说明这种说法存在的问题。

Method: 这种方法涉及对语言模型在三个不同层面（实现、算法表示和计算理论）的表现进行评估。

Result: 评估结果显示语言模型在实现层面存在问题，算法表示层面动机不足，在计算理论层面存在问题。

Conclusion: 因此，该研究建议将语言模型视为认知模型可能是一种夸大其词的说法，不应过分推广大型语言模型（LLMs）的热度。

Abstract: Futrell and Mahowald claim LMs "serve as model systems", but an assessment at each of Marr's three levels suggests the claim is clearly not true at the implementation level, poorly motivated at the algorithmic-representational level, and problematic at the computational theory level. LMs are good candidates as tools; calling them cognitive models overstates the case and unnecessarily feeds LLM hype.

TL;DR: 该研究定义了手术规划的正确性，并通过一个多中心的元评估基准评估视觉-语言模型在手术规划中的表现，发现序列相似度指标不能准确评价规划质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决视觉-语言模型在安全关键设置中的评估难题，该研究基于手术规划的目标导向观点，定义规划正确性并通过一个多中心的元评估基准进行评估。

Method: 引入了一个多中心的元评估基准，其中包含有效的程序变体和无效规划。使用基于规则的目标满足度指标来评估视觉-语言模型，并在逐步受限的环境中揭示感知错误和不足约束的推理问题。

Result: 序列相似度指标系统地误判规划质量，会对有效规划进行惩罚，同时又无法识别无效规划。因此，研究采用基于规则的目标满足度指标作为高精度的元评估参考。

Conclusion: 结构知识能持续提高性能，而仅依赖语义指导是不可靠的，仅在与结构性约束结合下才对大型模型有益。

Abstract: Surgical planning integrates visual perception, long-horizon reasoning, and procedural knowledge, yet it remains unclear whether current evaluation protocols reliably assess vision-language models (VLMs) in safety-critical settings. Motivated by a goal-oriented view of surgical planning, we define planning correctness via phase-goal satisfiability, where plan validity is determined by expert-defined surgical rules. Based on this definition, we introduce a multicentric meta-evaluation benchmark with valid procedural variations and invalid plans containing order and content errors. Using this benchmark, we show that sequence similarity metrics systematically misjudge planning quality, penalizing valid plans while failing to identify invalid ones. We therefore adopt a rule-based goal-satisfiability metric as a high-precision meta-evaluation reference to assess Video-LLMs under progressively constrained settings, revealing failures due to perception errors and under-constrained reasoning. Structural knowledge consistently improves performance, whereas semantic guidance alone is unreliable and benefits larger models only when combined with structural constraints.

TL;DR: 介绍了AEQ-Bench基准，用于系统评估大模型的同理能力，包括生成基于多模态（音频+文本）的情感回应和评估音频回应的同理程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于同理具有情感性，其自动评估是一个重要但具有挑战性的任务。AEQ-Bench旨在解决这一挑战，提供了一种系统的方法来评估大模型的同理能力。

Method: AEQ-Bench包括两个新的评估设置，可以评估大模型在不同上下文和语音音调下的同理表达能力。研究从语义和副语义指标进行了全面评估。

Result: (1) 配备了音频输出能力的大模型通常优于仅输出文本的大模型；(2) 大模型在粗粒度的质量评估上与人类判断一致，但在细粒度的副语义表达性评估上不可靠。

Conclusion: AEQ-Bench提供了一种新颖的方法来更好地理解和评估大模型的同理能力。

Abstract: While the automatic evaluation of omni-modal large models (OLMs) is essential, assessing empathy remains a significant challenge due to its inherent affectivity. To investigate this challenge, we introduce AEQ-Bench (Audio Empathy Quotient Benchmark), a novel benchmark to systematically assess two core empathetic capabilities of OLMs: (i) generating empathetic responses by comprehending affective cues from multi-modal inputs (audio + text), and (ii) judging the empathy of audio responses without relying on text transcription. Compared to existing benchmarks, AEQ-Bench incorporates two novel settings that vary in context specificity and speech tone. Comprehensive assessment across linguistic and paralinguistic metrics reveals that (1) OLMs trained with audio output capabilities generally outperformed models with text-only outputs, and (2) while OLMs align with human judgments for coarse-grained quality assessment, they remain unreliable for evaluating fine-grained paralinguistic expressiveness.

TL;DR: PERM 提出了一种新的人性化奖励建模方法，通过支持者、求助者和旁观者的视角进行双向分解来评估同情心，实验结果显示其性能优于现有基线，并得到用户研究的验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感支持的强化学习模型通常从单一角度评估同情心，忽略了实践框架中同情心的双向性质。为此，提出了心理学依据的 Empathetic Reward Modeling (PERM)，以评估同情心的双向性质。

Method: PERM 通过支持者视角评估内部共鸣和沟通表达，通过求助者视角评估情感接收，并引入旁观者视角监控整体互动质量，实现双向分解。

Result: PERM 在广泛使用的情绪 intelligance 验证基准和工业每日对话数据集上取得了显著的性能提升，优于当前最先进的基线方法。同时，盲法用户研究还显示了 PERM 生成更具同情心的响应的高偏好度，偏好率达到 70％。

Conclusion: PERM 提出了一个提高 LLMs 情感支持性能的创新方法，展示出了在情绪支持领域具有重要的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in human-centric applications, yet they often fail to provide substantive emotional support. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been utilized to enhance empathy of LLMs, existing reward models typically evaluate empathy from a single perspective, overlooking the inherently bidirectional interaction nature of empathy between the supporter and seeker as defined by Empathy Cycle theory. To address this limitation, we propose Psychology-grounded Empathetic Reward Modeling (PERM). PERM operationalizes empathy evaluation through a bidirectional decomposition: 1) Supporter perspective, assessing internal resonation and communicative expression; 2) Seeker perspective, evaluating emotional reception. Additionally, it incorporates a bystander perspective to monitor overall interaction quality. Extensive experiments on a widely-used emotional intelligence benchmark and an industrial daily conversation dataset demonstrate that PERM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 10\%. Furthermore, a blinded user study reveals a 70\% preference for our approach, highlighting its efficacy in generating more empathetic responses. Our code, dataset, and models are available at https://github.com/ZhengWwwq/PERM.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为知识免疫框架（KIF）的知识擦除方法，通过针对内部激活特征而非表面输出进行动态抑制和参数高效适应，实现近似完全的知识擦除，同时保持模型的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的知识删除方法混淆了行为抑制和真正的知识移除，导致潜在能力的持续存在，而KIF通过区分真正擦除和混淆，解决了这一问题。

Method: KIF通过动态抑制主题特异性表示和参数高效适应，而不进行完整的模型重新训练，实现持久的知识擦除。

Result: KIF在不重新训练模型的情况下实现几乎完美的知识擦除（FQ约为0.99），同时保持模型实用性（MU为0.62），首次全面评估了不同规模和类型的模型。

Conclusion: KIF通过结合表面泄漏和潜在痕迹的持续性双重评估标准，区分了混淆和真正擦除，为不同类型模型提供了机制级别的遗忘行为诊断工具。

Abstract: Selective knowledge erasure from LLMs is critical for GDPR compliance and model safety, yet current unlearning methods conflate behavioral suppression with true knowledge removal, allowing latent capabilities to persist beneath surface-level refusals. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing Knowledge Immunization Framework (KIF), a representation-aware architecture that distinguishes genuine erasure from obfuscation by targeting internal activation signatures rather than surface outputs. Our approach combines dynamic suppression of subject-specific representations with parameter-efficient adaptation, enabling durable unlearning without full model retraining. KIF achieves near-oracle erasure (FQ approx 0.99 vs. 1.00) while preserving utility at oracle levels (MU = 0.62), effectively breaking the stability-erasure tradeoff that has constrained all prior work. We evaluate both standard foundation models (Llama and Mistral) and reasoning-prior models (Qwen and DeepSeek) across 3B to 14B parameters. Our observation shows that standard models exhibit scale-independent true erasure (<3% utility drift), while reasoning-prior models reveal fundamental architectural divergence. Our comprehensive dual-metric evaluation protocol, combining surface-level leakage with latent trace persistence, operationalizes the obfuscation - erasure distinction and enables the first systematic diagnosis of mechanism-level forgetting behavior across model families and scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前常用的一些内在评估指标（如困惑度或字节/字符数）在多语言环境下使用时依赖于一些潜在的假设，该研究旨在明确这些假设并探讨它们带来的影响。

Method: 研究通过对比六种评估指标在两个多平行语料库（同时包含单语言和多语言模型）上的表现，分析其在不同环境下的适用性和局限性。

Result: 研究结果显示，当前的评估指标在不同语言环境下并不可互换比较，揭示了信息论意义上信息量与语言实例间意义的不同。

Conclusion: 研究结论认为存在‘形式-意义’辩论（form-meaning debate），即模型内部表达的信息量（信息论定义）与人类理解的意义间存在差异，导致当前评估指标存在局限性，需进一步探索新的评价方法。

Abstract: Intrinsic evaluation metrics for conditional language models, such as perplexity or bits-per-character, are widely used in both mono- and multilingual settings. These metrics are rather straightforward to use and compare in monolingual setups, but rest on a number of assumptions in multilingual setups. One such assumption is that comparing the perplexity of CLMs on parallel sentences is indicative of their quality since the information content (here understood as the semantic meaning) is the same. However, the metrics are inherently measuring information content in the information-theoretic sense. We make this and other such assumptions explicit and discuss their implications. We perform experiments with six metrics on two multi-parallel corpora both with mono- and multilingual models. Ultimately, we find that current metrics are not universally comparable. We look at the form-meaning debate to provide some explanation for this.

TL;DR: TracVC方法通过信息检索和影响估计将生成的自信表达追溯到训练数据，以衡量LLM对内容相关训练数据（与问题和答案相关）的信任程度。研究揭示了LLM可能不依赖于真实的主题内容而是模仿表面的语言表达自信确定性的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM过于自信的问题使得其声明的自信度不可靠。TracVC方法旨在通过分析不同LLM模型如何依赖于词汇和内容相关的训练数据来增强其表达可靠自信的能力。

Method: TracVC方法结合了信息检索和影响估计，将生成的自信表达回溯到训练数据，提出了一种新颖的衡量标准，即内容相关性（content groundness），量化LLM在问题回答时自信程度是否基于内容相关而非泛化的自信表述。

Result: TracVC在OLMo和Llama模型上得到了验证。研究结果揭示了OLMo2-13B等模型倾向于被与其查询词汇无关但表达自信的语言数据影响，这表明它们可能模仿表面的语言确定性表达，而忽视了基于真正内容的自信表达。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，当前的LLM训练可能缺乏了解决如何在适当情境下真正表达自信的能力。TracVC方法提供了一个基础，为进一步提高LLM表达可靠自信的性能提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can increase users' perceived trust by verbalizing confidence in their outputs. However, prior work has shown that LLMs are often overconfident, making their stated confidence unreliable since it does not consistently align with factual accuracy. To better understand the sources of this verbalized confidence, we introduce TracVC (\textbf{Trac}ing \textbf{V}erbalized \textbf{C}onfidence), a method that builds on information retrieval and influence estimation to trace generated confidence expressions back to the training data. We evaluate TracVC on OLMo and Llama models in a question answering setting, proposing a new metric, content groundness, which measures the extent to which an LLM grounds its confidence in content-related training examples (relevant to the question and answer) versus in generic examples of confidence verbalization. Our analysis reveals that OLMo2-13B is frequently influenced by confidence-related data that is lexically unrelated to the query, suggesting that it may mimic superficial linguistic expressions of certainty rather than rely on genuine content grounding. These findings point to a fundamental limitation in current training regimes: LLMs may learn how to sound confident without learning when confidence is justified. Our analysis provides a foundation for improving LLMs' trustworthiness in expressing more reliable confidence.

Result: 策略导向的推理方法提高了说服力预测的准确性。还对Winning Arguments数据集进行了重新组织，并分析了不同讨论主题的表现。

Conclusion: 通过这种方法，作者展示了结构化、策略感知的提示在提高预测说服力时的可解释性和鲁棒性。此外，还公开了一个带有讨论主题标注的数据集，以促进未来的研究。

Abstract: Detecting persuasion in argumentative text is a challenging task with important implications for understanding human communication. This work investigates the role of persuasion strategies - such as Attack on reputation, Distraction, and Manipulative wording - in determining the persuasiveness of a text. We conduct experiments on three annotated argument datasets: Winning Arguments (built from the Change My View subreddit), Anthropic/Persuasion, and Persuasion for Good. Our approach leverages large language models (LLMs) with a Multi-Strategy Persuasion Scoring approach that guides reasoning over six persuasion strategies. Results show that strategy-guided reasoning improves the prediction of persuasiveness. To better understand the influence of content, we organize the Winning Argument dataset into broad discussion topics and analyze performance across them. We publicly release this topic-annotated version of the dataset to facilitate future research. Overall, our methodology demonstrates the value of structured, strategy-aware prompting for enhancing interpretability and robustness in argument quality assessment.

TL;DR: STITCH 提出了一种基于结构化意图跟踪的主动记忆系统，通过索引每个步骤的结构化检索线索和上下文意图来识别相关历史。该系统在 CAME-Bench 和 LongMemEval 上实现最优性能，显著降低了检索噪音，支持长周期的鲁棒推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对长周期、目标导向互动中相似实体和事实由于潜在目标和约束变化而出现的检索上下文不匹配问题，现有记忆系统无法有效应对。

Method: STITCH 通过为每个步骤索引结构化检索线索（包含上下文意图、当前潜在目标、行动类型和相关实体类型）并根据当前步骤的意图过滤和优先级排序记忆片段来实现高效历史检索。

Result: STITCH 在 CAME-Bench 和 LongMemEval 上表现出最优性能，相比最强基线提高了 35.6% 的表现，特别是在长周期轨迹上。

Conclusion: STITCH 通过意图索引显著减少了检索噪音，提升了长周期推理的鲁棒性，为持续记忆系统的设计提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Deploying large language models in long-horizon, goal-oriented interactions remains challenging because similar entities and facts recur under different latent goals and constraints, causing memory systems to retrieve context-mismatched evidence. We propose STITCH (Structured Intent Tracking in Contextual History), an agentic memory system that indexes each trajectory step with a structured retrieval cue, contextual intent, and retrieves history by matching the current step's intent. Contextual intent provides compact signals that disambiguate repeated mentions and reduce interference: (1) the current latent goal defining a thematic segment, (2) the action type, and (3) the salient entity types anchoring which attributes matter. During inference, STITCH filters and prioritizes memory snippets by intent compatibility, suppressing semantically similar but context-incompatible history.
  For evaluation, we introduce CAME-Bench, a benchmark for context-aware retrieval in realistic, dynamic, goal-oriented trajectories. Across CAME-Bench and LongMemEval, STITCH achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 35.6%, with the largest gains as trajectory length increases. Our analysis shows that intent indexing substantially reduces retrieval noise, supporting intent-aware memory for robust long-horizon reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在任务复杂的场景下效果不佳，尤其是长周期、多轮交互的场景中，因为这些方法无法明确区分有效的工具使用和冗余或错误的工具使用。

Method: MatchTIR 通过二分匹配问题来计算预测痕迹和真实痕迹之间的匹配，采用两种分配策略来获得密集的交互回合级别的奖励。同时，引入了双层优势估计方案，综合考虑局部步骤精度和全局任务成功。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，MatchTIR 的 4B 模型超越了大多数 8B 竞争对手，特别是在长周期和多轮任务中。

Conclusion: MatchTIR 实验结果表明，这种精细监督的新框架在处理复杂任务方面有明显优势。

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) empowers large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks by interleaving reasoning steps with external tool interactions. However, existing reinforcement learning methods typically rely on outcome- or trajectory-level rewards, assigning uniform advantages to all steps within a trajectory. This coarse-grained credit assignment fails to distinguish effective tool calls from redundant or erroneous ones, particularly in long-horizon multi-turn scenarios. To address this, we propose MatchTIR, a framework that introduces fine-grained supervision via bipartite matching-based turn-level reward assignment and dual-level advantage estimation. Specifically, we formulate credit assignment as a bipartite matching problem between predicted and ground-truth traces, utilizing two assignment strategies to derive dense turn-level rewards. Furthermore, to balance local step precision with global task success, we introduce a dual-level advantage estimation scheme that integrates turn-level and trajectory-level signals, assigning distinct advantage values to individual interaction turns. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MatchTIR. Notably, our 4B model surpasses the majority of 8B competitors, particularly in long-horizon and multi-turn tasks.

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种基于阈值的入院政策，该政策在高峰拥挤期间将非紧急患者重定向至其他护理路径，如远程医疗。该研究通过提出一个两类$M/M/c$优先级排队系统以及基于水平相关多项式Birth-Death过程的模型，确定了最优阈值，以最大化包含重定向影响的收入和与患者流失及系统占用相关的成本的时间平均目标函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改善急诊部门的过度拥挤及其导致的患者延误情况，提升护理质量。

Method: 通过$M/M/c$排队模型，应用水平相关多项式Born-Death过程分析，优化资源分配。

Result: 研究表明，农村急诊部门通常需要较低的重定向阈值，而城市急诊部门在中等阈值时表现出最佳性能。在农村和城市环境中，这一政策分别可以提高4.84%和5.90%的性能。

Conclusion: 我们的方法提供了一个数学上严格的框架，用以平衡临床优先级与运营效率，在不同类型的急诊部门中都有效。

Abstract: Emergency department (ED) overcrowding and patient boarding represent critical systemic challenges that compromise care quality. We propose a threshold-based admission policy that redirects non-urgent patients to alternative care pathways, such as telemedicine, during peak congestion. The ED is modeled as a two-class $M/M/c$ preemptive-priority queuing system, where high-acuity patients are prioritized and low-acuity patients are subject to state-dependent redirection. Analyzed via a level-dependent Quasi-Birth-Death (QBD) process, the model determines the optimal threshold by maximizing a long-run time-averaged objective function comprising redirection-affected revenue and costs associated with patient balking and system occupancy. Numerical analysis using national healthcare data reveals that optimal policies are highly context-dependent. While rural EDs generally optimize at lower redirection thresholds, urban EDs exhibit performance peaks at moderate thresholds. Results indicate that our optimal policy yields significant performance gains of up to $4.84\%$ in rural settings and $5.90\%$ in urban environments. This research provides a mathematically rigorous framework for balancing clinical priority with operational efficiency across diverse ED settings.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一款名为VarMRI的工具链，该工具链用于监测和分析导致延迟变化的内核和硬件事件，并在长时间监测中通过有选择地记录事件数据来解决大数据问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究延迟变化背后由内核和硬件事件引起的因素，以便发现程序或基准测试中的性能瓶颈，通常这些因素在应用程序层面是不可见的。

Method: 构建了VarMRI工具链，该工具链首先记录粗粒度信息，只有在必要时记录额外详细信息；此外，它采用了高效的大数据分析方法，对不同数据集和缺失数据具有稳健性。

Result: 通过在CloudLab上进行为期3000小时的六种应用程序和基准测试研究，发现了包括中断抢占、Java垃圾回收、流水线停滞和NUMA平衡在内的多种引起延迟变化的事件；简单的优化或调整可以将尾部延迟降低31%。

Conclusion: 这一研究揭示了长时间监控的必要性，并表明即使简单的优化措施也可以显著改善性能。

Abstract: This paper presents our experience to understand latency variance caused by kernel and hardware events, which are often invisible at the application level. For this purpose, we have built VarMRI, a tool chain to monitor and analyze those events in the long term. To mitigate the "big data" problem caused by long-term monitoring, VarMRI selectively records a subset of events following two principles: it only records events that are affecting the requests recorded by the application; it records coarse-grained information first and records additional information only when necessary. Furthermore, VarMRI introduces an analysis method that is efficient on large amount of data, robust on different data set and against missing data, and informative to the user.
  VarMRI has helped us to carry out a 3,000-hour study of six applications and benchmarks on CloudLab. It reveals a wide variety of events causing latency variance, including interrupt preemption, Java GC, pipeline stall, NUMA balancing etc.; simple optimization or tuning can reduce tail latencies by up to 31%. Furthermore, the impacts of some of these events vary significantly across different experiments, which confirms the necessity of long-term monitoring.

Motivation: 由于ChatGPT的发布引发了关于AI系统是否构成人类生存威胁的大辩论，作者提出了构建AI系统存在风险的一般框架，以更深入地理解并应对这一挑战。

Method: 作者通过对两个前提进行分析，构建了一个涉及科学障碍防止AI系统变得强大的情景，人类禁止AI研究，AI系统不愿或无法摧毁人类，以及人类能够可靠地检测并阻止危险AI系统的生存故事分类。随后，他们用这一分类来估计人类被AI毁灭的概率。

Result: 作者提出了一种分类方法，展示了不同情境下AI系统可能造成的不同风险，并提供了对人类面临AI威胁程度的不同估计。

Conclusion: 本文提供了对AI系统是否存在风险的深度分析，并提出了相应的策略建议，以减轻相关的威胁。

Abstract: Since the release of ChatGPT, there has been a lot of debate about whether AI systems pose an existential risk to humanity. This paper develops a general framework for thinking about the existential risk of AI systems. We analyze a two premise argument that AI systems pose a threat to humanity. Premise one: AI systems will become extremely powerful. Premise two: if AI systems become extremely powerful, they will destroy humanity. We use these two premises to construct a taxonomy of survival stories, in which humanity survives into the far future. In each survival story, one of the two premises fails. Either scientific barriers prevent AI systems from becoming extremely powerful; or humanity bans research into AI systems, thereby preventing them from becoming extremely powerful; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because their goals prevent them from doing so; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because we can reliably detect and disable systems that have the goal of doing so. We argue that different survival stories face different challenges. We also argue that different survival stories motivate different responses to the threats from AI. Finally, we use our taxonomy to produce rough estimates of P(doom), the probability that humanity will be destroyed by AI.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid spread of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about the social reactions they provoke. Prior research documents negative attitudes toward AI users, but it remains unclear whether such disapproval translates into costly action. We address this question in a two-phase online experiment (N = 491 Phase II participants; Phase I provided targets) where participants could spend part of their own endowment to reduce the earnings of peers who had previously completed a real-effort task with or without LLM support. On average, participants destroyed 36% of the earnings of those who relied exclusively on the model, with punishment increasing monotonically with actual LLM use. Disclosure about LLM use created a credibility gap: self-reported null use was punished more harshly than actual null use, suggesting that declarations of "no use" are treated with suspicion. Conversely, at high levels of use, actual reliance on the model was punished more strongly than self-reported reliance. Taken together, these findings provide the first behavioral evidence that the efficiency gains of LLMs come at the cost of social sanctions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modern logical reasoning with LLMs primarily relies on employing complex interactive frameworks that decompose the reasoning process into subtasks solved through carefully designed prompts or requiring external resources (e.g., symbolic solvers) to exploit their strong logical structures. While interactive approaches introduce additional overhead, hybrid approaches depend on external components, which limit their scalability. A non-interactive, end-to-end framework enables reasoning to emerge within the model itself -- improving generalization while preserving analyzability without any external resources. In this work, we introduce a non-interactive, end-to-end framework for reasoning tasks. We show that introducing structural information into the few-shot prompt activates a subset of attention heads that patterns aligned with logical reasoning operators. Building on this insight, we propose Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI), an inference-time intervention method that reweights attention scores across selected heads identified by their logical patterns. AAI offers an efficient way to steer the model's reasoning toward leveraging prior knowledge through attention modulation. Extensive experiments show that AAI enhances logical reasoning performance across diverse benchmarks and model architectures, while incurring negligible additional computational overhead.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Sequential test-time scaling is a promising training-free method to improve large reasoning model accuracy, but as currently implemented, significant limitations have been observed. Inducing models to think for longer can increase their accuracy, but as the length of reasoning is further extended, it has also been shown to result in accuracy degradation and model instability. This work presents a novel sequential test-time scaling method, Min-Seek, which improves model accuracy significantly over a wide range of induced thoughts, stabilizing the accuracy of sequential scaling, and removing the need for reasoning length fine-tuning. Beyond improving model accuracy over a variety of reasoning tasks, our method is inherently efficient, as only the KV pairs of one additional induced thought are kept in the KV cache during reasoning. With a custom KV cache which stores keys without position embeddings, by dynamically encoding them contiguously before each new generated thought, our method can continue to reason well beyond a model's maximum context length, and under mild conditions has linear computational complexity.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Anthropomorphisation -- the phenomenon whereby non-human entities are ascribed human-like qualities -- has become increasingly salient with the rise of large language model (LLM)-based conversational agents (CAs). Unlike earlier chatbots, LLM-based CAs routinely generate interactional and linguistic cues, such as first-person self-reference, epistemic and affective expressions that empirical work shows can increase engagement. On the other hand, anthropomorphisation raises ethical concerns, including deception, overreliance, and exploitative relationship framing, while some authors argue that anthropomorphic interaction may support autonomy, well-being, and inclusion. Despite increasing interest in the phenomenon, literature remains fragmented across domains and varies substantially in how it defines, operationalizes, and normatively evaluates anthropomorphisation. This scoping review maps ethically oriented work on anthropomorphising LLM-based CAs across five databases and three preprint repositories. We synthesize (1) conceptual foundations, (2) ethical challenges and opportunities, and (3) methodological approaches. We find convergence on attribution-based definitions but substantial divergence in operationalization, a predominantly risk-forward normative framing, and limited empirical work that links observed interaction effects to actionable governance guidance. We conclude with a research agenda and design/governance recommendations for ethically deploying anthropomorphic cues in LLM-based conversational agents.

Motivation: 尽管人类与人工智能的互补性得到了研究领域的广泛认可，但其理论基础并不牢固，且难以在实践中获得。本文借鉴证成人工智能的研究，提出了一个通过历史实例来评估人类与人工智能交互可靠性的框架。

Method: 本文采用了计算 reliabilism（可靠性主义），将历史上的互补案例视为可靠认知过程的证据。通过结合其他可靠性的指标，比如团队与认知标准和技术实践的契合度，本文揭示了互补性如何促进人工智能团队的预测可靠性。

Result: 本文提出的方法强调了人类与人工智能互补性的价值并不在于相对预测准确性，而是有助于校准决策以适应和支持日益依赖于人工智能支持过程的日常生活可靠性。

Conclusion: 本文为如何评估和利用人类与人工智能的互补性提供了新的视角，强调其在确保AI支持过程可靠性和提升社会对AI信任度方面的作用。

Abstract: Human-AI complementarity is the claim that a human supported by an AI system can outperform either alone in a decision-making process. Since its introduction in the human-AI interaction literature, it has gained traction by generalizing the reliance paradigm and by offering a more practical alternative to the contested construct of 'trust in AI.' Yet complementarity faces key theoretical challenges: it lacks precise theoretical anchoring, it is formalized just as a post hoc indicator of relative predictive accuracy, it remains silent about other desiderata of human-AI interactions and it abstracts away from the magnitude-cost profile of its performance gain. As a result, complementarity is difficult to obtain in empirical settings. In this work, we leverage epistemology to address these challenges by reframing complementarity within the discourse on justificatory AI. Drawing on computational reliabilism, we argue that historical instances of complementarity function as evidence that a given human-AI interaction is a reliable epistemic process for a given predictive task. Together with other reliability indicators assessing the alignment of the human-AI team with the epistemic standards and socio-technical practices, complementarity contributes to the degree of reliability of human-AI teams when generating predictions. This supports the practical reasoning of those affected by these outputs -- patients, managers, regulators, and others. In summary, our approach suggests that the role and value of complementarity lies not in providing a relative measure of predictive accuracy, but in helping calibrate decision-making to the reliability of AI-supported processes that increasingly shape everyday life.

Motivation: 当前的RAG系统存在信息无限存储、检索只读且缺乏时间连续性的缺点，这妨碍了大型语言模型（LLM）在长时间任务中的表现。

Method: 定义了一种连续记忆架构（CMA），通过持久存储、选择性保留、关联路由、时间链结和高层抽象化等机制来解决RAG的问题。

Result: 研究通过实证方法证明CMA在涉及RAG固有的记忆无法积累、修改或消歧的任务中表现出一致的行为优势。

Conclusion: 研究指出CMA对于解决长期任务问题至关重要，同时指出了延迟、漂移和解释性方面的开放挑战。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the default strategy for providing large language model (LLM) agents with contextual knowledge. Yet RAG treats memory as a stateless lookup table: information persists indefinitely, retrieval is read-only, and temporal continuity is absent. We define the \textit{Continuum Memory Architecture} (CMA), a class of systems that maintain and update internal state across interactions through persistent storage, selective retention, associative routing, temporal chaining, and consolidation into higher-order abstractions. Rather than disclosing implementation specifics, we specify the architectural requirements CMA imposes and show consistent behavioral advantages on tasks that expose RAG's structural inability to accumulate, mutate, or disambiguate memory. The empirical probes (knowledge updates, temporal association, associative recall, contextual disambiguation) demonstrate that CMA is a necessary architectural primitive for long-horizon agents while highlighting open challenges around latency, drift, and interpretability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) offer transformative potential for high-stakes domains like finance and law, but their tendency to hallucinate, generating factually incorrect or unsupported content, poses a critical reliability risk. This paper introduces a comprehensive operational framework for hallucination management, built on a continuous improvement cycle driven by root cause awareness. We categorize hallucination sources into model, data, and context-related factors, allowing targeted interventions over generic fixes. The framework integrates multi-faceted detection methods (e.g., uncertainty estimation, reasoning consistency) with stratified mitigation strategies (e.g., knowledge grounding, confidence calibration). We demonstrate its application through a tiered architecture and a financial data extraction case study, where model, context, and data tiers form a closed feedback loop for progressive reliability enhancement. This approach provides a systematic, scalable methodology for building trustworthy generative AI systems in regulated environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress in domain-specific applications, particularly within the legal domain. However, general-purpose models such as GPT-4 often struggle with specialized subdomains that require precise legal knowledge, complex reasoning, and contextual sensitivity. To address these limitations, we present LabourLawLLM, a legal large language model tailored to Chinese labor law. We also introduce LabourLawBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering diverse labor-law tasks, including legal provision citation, knowledge-based question answering, case classification, compensation computation, named entity recognition, and legal case analysis. Our evaluation framework combines objective metrics (e.g., ROUGE-L, accuracy, F1, and soft-F1) with subjective assessment based on GPT-4 scoring. Experiments show that LabourLawLLM consistently outperforms general-purpose and existing legal-specific LLMs across task categories. Beyond labor law, our methodology provides a scalable approach for building specialized LLMs in other legal subfields, improving accuracy, reliability, and societal value of legal AI applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Personalizing Large Language Models typically relies on static retrieval or one-time adaptation, assuming user preferences remain invariant over time. However, real-world interactions are dynamic, where user interests continuously evolve, posing a challenge for models to adapt to preference drift without catastrophic forgetting. Standard continual learning approaches often struggle in this context, as they indiscriminately update on noisy interaction streams, failing to distinguish genuine preference shifts from transient contexts. To address this, we introduce SPRInG, a novel semi-parametric framework designed for effective continual personalization. During training, SPRInG employs drift-driven selective adaptation, which utilizes a likelihood-based scoring function to identify high-novelty interactions. This allows the model to selectively update the user-specific adapter on drift signals while preserving hard-to-learn residuals in a replay buffer. During inference, we apply strict relevance gating and fuse parametric knowledge with retrieved history via logit interpolation. Experiments on the long-form personalized generation benchmark demonstrate that SPRInG outperforms existing baselines, validating its robustness for real-world continual personalization.

TL;DR: Memo-SQL 是一种训练无需的方法，通过结构化分解和经验感知自我更正来解决现有 NL2SQL 系统中的两个关键限制，从而实现高效准确的SQL生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NL2SQL 系统存在依赖上下文学习的限制，忽略历史错误修正对的丰富信号，以及在测试时缩放方法分解问题导致生成类似SQL候选并减少增益，且这些方法在准确性和效率之间存在权衡。

Method: Memo-SQL 采用结构化分解和经验感知自我更正两种简单想法。结构化分解包括实体级、层次和原子序列三种策略，以鼓励多样性推理；经验感知自我更正构建包含成功查询和历史错误修正对的动态记忆，并在推理时使用检索增强提示引入相关示例，无需微调或外部API。

Result: 在 BIRD 数据集上，Memo-SQL 达到 68.5% 的执行准确率，超越了无需微调的方法的新状态，并且使用的资源比之前测试时间缩放方法少超过10倍。

Conclusion: Memo-SQL 通过有效利用历史数据和改进推理分解，提供了更高准确性和效率的解决方案，证明了无需训练框架在自然语言到SQL转换中的有效性。

Abstract: Existing NL2SQL systems face two critical limitations: (1) they rely on in-context learning with only correct examples, overlooking the rich signal in historical error-fix pairs that could guide more robust self-correction; and (2) test-time scaling approaches often decompose questions arbitrarily, producing near-identical SQL candidates across runs and diminishing ensemble gains. Moreover, these methods suffer from a stark accuracy-efficiency trade-off: high performance demands excessive computation, while fast variants compromise quality. We present Memo-SQL, a training-free framework that addresses these issues through two simple ideas: structured decomposition and experience-aware self-correction. Instead of leaving decomposition to chance, we apply three clear strategies, entity-wise, hierarchical, and atomic sequential, to encourage diverse reasoning. For correction, we build a dynamic memory of both successful queries and historical error-fix pairs, and use retrieval-augmented prompting to bring relevant examples into context at inference time, no fine-tuning or external APIs required. On BIRD, Memo-SQL achieves 68.5% execution accuracy, setting a new state of the art among open, zero-fine-tuning methods, while using over 10 times fewer resources than prior TTS approaches.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The scientific computation of large deformations in elastic-plastic solids is crucial in various manufacturing applications. Traditional numerical methods exhibit several inherent limitations, prompting Deep Learning (DL) as a promising alternative. The effectiveness of current DL techniques typically depends on the availability of high-quantity and high-accuracy datasets, which are yet difficult to obtain in large deformation problems. During the dataset construction process, a dilemma stands between data quantity and data accuracy, leading to suboptimal performance in the DL models. To address this challenge, we focus on a representative application of large deformations, the stretch bending problem, and propose FilDeep, a Fidelity-based Deep Learning framework for large Deformation of elastic-plastic solids. Our FilDeep aims to resolve the quantity-accuracy dilemma by simultaneously training with both low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, where the former provides greater quantity but lower accuracy, while the latter offers higher accuracy but in less quantity. In FilDeep, we provide meticulous designs for the practical large deformation problem. Particularly, we propose attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to effectively capture long-range physical interactions across MF data. To the best of our knowledge, our FilDeep presents the first DL framework for large deformation problems using MF data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FilDeep consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be efficiently deployed in manufacturing.

Abstract: The past year has marked a turning point in the evolution and real-world use of large language models (LLMs). With the release of the first widely adopted reasoning model, o1, on December 5th, 2024, the field shifted from single-pass pattern generation to multi-step deliberation inference, accelerating deployment, experimentation, and new classes of applications. As this shift unfolded at a rapid pace, our empirical understanding of how these models have actually been used in practice has lagged behind. In this work, we leverage the OpenRouter platform, which is an AI inference provider across a wide variety of LLMs, to analyze over 100 trillion tokens of real-world LLM interactions across tasks, geographies, and time. In our empirical study, we observe substantial adoption of open-weight models, the outsized popularity of creative roleplay (beyond just the productivity tasks many assume dominate) and coding assistance categories, plus the rise of agentic inference. Furthermore, our retention analysis identifies foundational cohorts: early users whose engagement persists far longer than later cohorts. We term this phenomenon the Cinderella "Glass Slipper" effect. These findings underscore that the way developers and end-users engage with LLMs "in the wild" is complex and multifaceted. We discuss implications for model builders, AI developers, and infrastructure providers, and outline how a data-driven understanding of usage can inform better design and deployment of LLM systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As knowledge and semantics on the web grow increasingly complex, enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) comprehension and reasoning capabilities has become particularly important. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, it still falls short on logical reasoning tasks that rely on symbolic expressions and strict deductive rules. Neuro-symbolic methods address this gap by enforcing formal correctness through external solvers. Yet these solvers are highly format-sensitive, and small instabilities in model outputs can lead to frequent processing failures. LLM-driven approaches avoid parsing brittleness, but they lack structured representations and process-level error-correction mechanisms. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose MatrixCoT, a structured CoT framework with a matrix-based plan. Specifically, we normalize and type natural language expressions, attach explicit citation fields, and introduce a matrix-based planning method to preserve global relations among steps. The plan becomes a verifiable artifact, making execution more stable. For verification, we also add a feedback-driven replanning mechanism. Under semantic-equivalence constraints, it identifies omissions and defects, rewrites and compresses the dependency matrix, and produces a more trustworthy final answer. Experiments on five logical-reasoning benchmarks and five LLMs show that, without relying on external solvers, MatrixCoT enhances both robustness and interpretability when tackling complex symbolic reasoning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are challenging to deploy for domain-specific tasks due to their massive scale. While distilling a fine-tuned LLM into a smaller student model is a promising alternative, the capacity gap between teacher and student often leads to suboptimal performance. This raises a key question: when and how can a student model match or even surpass its teacher on domain-specific tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical insight: a student can outperform its teacher if its advantage on a Student-Favored Subdomain (SFS) outweighs its deficit on the Teacher-Favored Subdomain (TFS). Guided by this insight, we propose Scheduled Checkpoint Distillation (SCD), which reduces the TFS deficit by emulating the teacher's convergence process during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the domain task, and a sample-wise Adaptive Weighting (AW) mechanism to preserve student strengths on SFS. Experiments across diverse domain tasks--including QA, NER, and text classification in multiple languages--show that our method consistently outperforms existing distillation approaches, allowing the student model to match or even exceed the performance of its fine-tuned teacher.

Abstract: Generating molecules that satisfy precise numeric constraints over multiple physicochemical properties is critical and challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multi-objective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce \textbf{M olGen}, a fragment-level, retrieval-augmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints. Stage I : Prototype generation: a multi-agent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II : RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multi-hop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets. Experiments on generation under two sets of property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight and HOMO, LUMO) show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning and prediction across different domains. Yet, their ability to infer temporal regularities from structured behavioral data remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic study investigating whether LLMs can predict time intervals between recurring user actions, such as repeated purchases, and how different levels of contextual information shape their predictive behavior. Using a simple but representative repurchase scenario, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings against both statistical and machine-learning models. Two key findings emerge. First, while LLMs surpass lightweight statistical baselines, they consistently underperform dedicated machine-learning models, showing their limited ability to capture quantitative temporal structure. Second, although moderate context can improve LLM accuracy, adding further user-level detail degrades performance. These results challenge the assumption that "more context leads to better reasoning". Our study highlights fundamental limitations of today's LLMs in structured temporal inference and offers guidance for designing future context-aware hybrid models that integrate statistical precision with linguistic flexibility.

Abstract: In quantitative finance, the gap between training and real-world performance-driven by concept drift and distributional non-stationarity-remains a critical obstacle for building reliable data-driven systems. Models trained on static historical data often overfit, resulting in poor generalization in dynamic markets. The mantra "History Is Not Enough" underscores the need for adaptive data generation that learns to evolve with the market rather than relying solely on past observations. We present a drift-aware dataflow system that integrates machine learning-based adaptive control into the data curation process. The system couples a parameterized data manipulation module comprising single-stock transformations, multi-stock mix-ups, and curation operations, with an adaptive planner-scheduler that employs gradient-based bi-level optimization to control the system. This design unifies data augmentation, curriculum learning, and data workflow management under a single differentiable framework, enabling provenance-aware replay and continuous data quality monitoring. Extensive experiments on forecasting and reinforcement learning trading tasks demonstrate that our framework enhances model robustness and improves risk-adjusted returns. The system provides a generalizable approach to adaptive data management and learning-guided workflow automation for financial data.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了将大型语言模型（LLMs）应用于长期序列决策任务，提出了一种名为DecisionLLM的方法，通过将轨迹作为模态并语言化任务描述来解决连续值解释问题，最终在目标环境和竞价场景中表现出色。

Motivation: 目前，长期序列决策问题通常通过强化学习（RL）解决， Decision Transformer (DT)将RL转化为自回归序列建模问题。大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂的推理和规划任务中展示了显著的能力。本文旨在探索是否存在更高效的新方法。

Result: 在离线实验基准和竞价场景中，DecisionLLM表现出色。具体而言，与传统的Decision Transformer (DT)相比，DecisionLLM-3B在Maze2D umaze-v1上的表现提升了69.4%，在AuctionNet上的表现提高了0.085。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，DLemma模型在某些RL任务中具有一定优势，并提供了在在线竞价领域进一步探索的可能方向。

Abstract: Long-sequence decision-making, which is usually addressed through reinforcement learning (RL), is a critical component for optimizing strategic operations in dynamic environments, such as real-time bidding in computational advertising. The Decision Transformer (DT) introduced a powerful paradigm by framing RL as an autoregressive sequence modeling problem. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning and planning tasks. This inspires us whether LLMs, which share the same Transformer foundation, but operate at a much larger scale, can unlock new levels of performance in long-horizon sequential decision-making problem. This work investigates the application of LLMs to offline decision making tasks. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the LLMs' inherent inability to interpret continuous values, as they lack a native understanding of numerical magnitude and order when values are represented as text strings. To address this, we propose treating trajectories as a distinct modality. By learning to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, our model can autoregressively predict future decisions within a cohesive framework we term DecisionLLM. We establish a set of scaling laws governing this paradigm, demonstrating that performance hinges on three factors: model scale, data volume, and data quality. In offline experimental benchmarks and bidding scenarios, DecisionLLM achieves strong performance. Specifically, DecisionLLM-3B outperforms the traditional Decision Transformer (DT) by 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and by 0.085 on AuctionNet. It extends the AIGB paradigm and points to promising directions for future exploration in online bidding.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform medical imaging by automating image analysis and accelerating clinical research. However, research and clinical use are limited by the wide variety of AI implementations and architectures, inconsistent documentation, and reproducibility issues. Here, we introduce MHub.ai, an open-source, container-based platform that standardizes access to AI models with minimal configuration, promoting accessibility and reproducibility in medical imaging. MHub.ai packages models from peer-reviewed publications into standardized containers that support direct processing of DICOM and other formats, provide a unified application interface, and embed structured metadata. Each model is accompanied by publicly available reference data that can be used to confirm model operation. MHub.ai includes an initial set of state-of-the-art segmentation, prediction, and feature extraction models for different modalities. The modular framework enables adaptation of any model and supports community contributions. We demonstrate the utility of the platform in a clinical use case through comparative evaluation of lung segmentation models. To further strengthen transparency and reproducibility, we publicly release the generated segmentations and evaluation metrics and provide interactive dashboards that allow readers to inspect individual cases and reproduce or extend our analysis. By simplifying model use, MHub.ai enables side-by-side benchmarking with identical execution commands and standardized outputs, and lowers the barrier to clinical translation.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted for Protein Representation Learning (PRL), as residue interaction networks can be naturally represented as graphs. Current GNN-based PRL methods typically rely on single-perspective graph construction strategies, which capture partial properties of residue interactions, resulting in incomplete protein representations. To address this limitation, we propose MMPG, a framework that constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fuses them via Mixture of Experts (MoE) for PRL. MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives to characterize different properties of residue interactions. To capture both perspective-specific features and their synergies, we develop an MoE module, which dynamically routes perspectives to specialized experts, where experts learn intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions. We quantitatively verify that MoE automatically specializes experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction from individual representations, to pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and ultimately to a global consensus across all perspectives. Through integrating this multi-level information, MMPG produces superior protein representations and achieves advanced performance on four different downstream protein tasks.

Abstract: Compositionality is a cognitive mechanism that allows humans to systematically combine known concepts in novel ways. This study demonstrates how artificial neural agents acquire and utilize compositional generalization to describe previously unseen images. Our method, termed "Composition through Decomposition", involves two sequential training steps. In the 'Decompose' step, the agents learn to decompose an image into basic concepts using a codebook acquired during interaction in a multi-target coordination game. Subsequently, in the 'Compose' step, the agents employ this codebook to describe novel images by composing basic concepts into complex phrases. Remarkably, we observe cases where generalization in the `Compose' step is achieved zero-shot, without the need for additional training.

Abstract: Automated analysis of needle electromyography (nEMG) signals is emerging as a tool to support the detection of neuromuscular diseases (NMDs), yet the signals' high and heterogeneous sampling rates pose substantial computational challenges for feature-based machine-learning models, particularly for near real-time analysis. Downsampling offers a potential solution, but its impact on diagnostic signal content and classification performance remains insufficiently understood. This study presents a workflow for systematically evaluating information loss caused by downsampling in high-frequency time series. The workflow combines shape-based distortion metrics with classification outcomes from available feature-based machine learning models and feature space analysis to quantify how different downsampling algorithms and factors affect both waveform integrity and predictive performance. We use a three-class NMD classification task to experimentally evaluate the workflow. We demonstrate how the workflow identifies downsampling configurations that preserve diagnostic information while substantially reducing computational load. Analysis of shape-based distortion metrics showed that shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation, as they better preserve peak structure and overall signal morphology. The results provide practical guidance for selecting downsampling configurations that enable near real-time nEMG analysis and highlight a generalisable workflow that can be used to balance data reduction with model performance in other high-frequency time-series applications as well.

Abstract: Group anomaly detection is crucial in many network applications, but faces challenges due to diverse anomaly patterns. Motivated by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, graph foundation models (GFMs) is proposed to handle few-shot learning task with fewer labeling efforts. GFMs have been successfully applied to detection of individual anomalies but cannot be generalized to group anomalies, as group anomaly patterns must be detected as a whole and individuals in an abnormal group can look rather normal. Therefore, we propose GFM4GA, a novel graph foundation model for group anomaly detection. The pipeline is pretrained via dual-level contrastive learning based on feature-based estimation and group extraction, to capture potential group anomaly structure and feature inconsistencies. In the downstream tasks, the pipeline is finetuned in parameter-constrained and group-anomaly-proportion weighted few-shot settings, and its adaptive ability to unseen group anomalies expanded via group contexts determined by labeled anomaly neighbors. Experiments show that GFM4GA surpasses group anomaly detectors and GFMs for individual anomalies, achieving average improvements of 2.85% in AUROC and 2.55% in AUPRC.

Abstract: In enterprise datasets, documents are rarely pure. They are not just text, nor just numbers; they are a complex amalgam of narrative and structure. Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have attempted to address this complexity with a blunt tool: linearization. We convert rich, multidimensional tables into simple Markdown-style text strings, hoping that an embedding model will capture the geometry of a spreadsheet in a single vector. But it has already been shown that this is mathematically insufficient.
  This work presents Topo-RAG, a framework that challenges the assumption that "everything is text". We propose a dual architecture that respects the topology of the data: we route fluid narrative through traditional dense retrievers, while tabular structures are processed by a Cell-Aware Late Interaction mechanism, preserving their spatial relationships. Evaluated on SEC-25, a synthetic enterprise corpus that mimics real-world complexity, Topo-RAG demonstrates an 18.4% improvement in nDCG@10 on hybrid queries compared to standard linearization approaches. It's not just about searching better; it's about understanding the shape of information.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning tasks like mathematical problem solving are vulnerable to cascading failures, where a single incorrect step leads to complete solution breakdown. Current LLM routing methods assign entire queries to one model, treating all reasoning steps as equal. We propose TRIM (Targeted routing in multi-step reasoning tasks), which routes only critical steps$\unicode{x2013}$those likely to derail the solution$\unicode{x2013}$to larger models while letting smaller models handle routine continuations. Our key insight is that targeted step-level interventions can fundamentally transform inference efficiency by confining expensive calls to precisely those steps where stronger models prevent cascading errors. TRIM operates at the step-level: it uses process reward models to identify erroneous steps and makes routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints. We develop several routing strategies within TRIM, ranging from a simple threshold-based policy to more expressive policies that reason about long-horizon accuracy-cost trade-offs and uncertainty in step-level correctness estimates. On MATH-500, even the simplest thresholding strategy surpasses prior routing methods with 5x higher cost efficiency, while more advanced policies match the strong, expensive model's performance using 80% fewer expensive model tokens. On harder benchmarks such as AIME, TRIM achieves up to 6x higher cost efficiency. All methods generalize effectively across math reasoning tasks, demonstrating that step-level difficulty represents fundamental characteristics of reasoning.

Abstract: We present NoReGeo, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the intrinsic geometric understanding of large language models (LLMs) without relying on reasoning or algebraic computation. Unlike existing benchmarks that primarily assess models' proficiency in reasoning-based geometry-where solutions are derived using algebraic methods-NoReGeo focuses on evaluating whether LLMs can inherently encode spatial relationships and recognize geometric properties directly. Our benchmark comprises 2,500 trivial geometric problems spanning 25 categories, each carefully crafted to be solvable purely through native geometric understanding, assuming known object locations. We assess a range of state-of-the-art models on NoReGeo, including frontier models like GPT-4, observing that even the most advanced systems achieve an overall maximum of 65% accuracy in binary classification tasks. Further, our ablation experiments demonstrate that such geometric understanding does not emerge through fine-tuning alone, indicating that effective training for geometric comprehension requires a specialized approach from the outset. Our findings highlight a significant gap in current LLMs' ability to natively grasp geometric concepts, providing a foundation for future research toward models with true geometric cognition.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has advanced LLM reasoning, applying it to long-context scenarios is hindered by sparsity of outcome rewards. This limitation fails to penalize ungrounded "lucky guesses," leaving the critical process of needle-in-a-haystack evidence retrieval largely unsupervised. To address this, we propose EAPO (Evidence-Augmented Policy Optimization). We first establish the Evidence-Augmented Reasoning paradigm, validating via Tree-Structured Evidence Sampling that precise evidence extraction is the decisive bottleneck for long-context reasoning. Guided by this insight, EAPO introduces a specialized RL algorithm where a reward model computes a Group-Relative Evidence Reward, providing dense process supervision to explicitly improve evidence quality. To sustain accurate supervision throughout training, we further incorporate an Adaptive Reward-Policy Co-Evolution mechanism. This mechanism iteratively refines the reward model using outcome-consistent rollouts, sharpening its discriminative capability to ensure precise process guidance. Comprehensive evaluations across eight benchmarks demonstrate that EAPO significantly enhances long-context reasoning performance compared to SOTA baselines.

Abstract: Heart rate variability (HRV) is a pivotal noninvasive marker for autonomic monitoring; however, applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to HRV interpretation is hindered by physiological hallucinations. These include respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) contamination, short-data instability in nonlinear metrics, and the neglect of individualized baselines in favor of population norms. We propose C-GRASP (Clinically-Grounded Reasoning for Affective Signal Processing), a guardrailed RAG-enhanced pipeline that decomposes HRV interpretation into eight traceable reasoning steps. Central to C-GRASP is a Z-score Priority Hierarchy that enforces the weighting of individualized baseline shifts over normative statistics. The system effectively mitigates spectral hallucinations through automated RSA-aware guardrails, preventing contamination of frequency-domain indices. Evaluated on 414 trials from the DREAMER dataset, C-GRASP integrated with high-scale reasoning models (e.g., MedGemma3-thinking) achieved superior performance in 4-class emotion classification (37.3% accuracy) and a Clinical Reasoning Consistency (CRC) score of 69.6%. Ablation studies confirm that the individualized Delta Z-score module serves as the critical logical anchor, preventing the "population bias" common in native LLMs. Ultimately, C-GRASP transitions affective computing from black-box classification to transparent, evidence-based clinical decision support, paving the way for safer AI integration in biomedical engineering.

Motivation: 现有的拒绝策略要么依赖于输出级指令遵循，这会导致模型幻觉的脆弱性；要么估计输出不确定性，这会增加复杂性和开销。因此，需要一个既能处理歧义和不可回答查询又能保持安全性的策略。

Method: 提出了一种称为LatentRefusal的机制，通过分析大型语言模型的中间隐藏激活来预测查询的可回答性。引入了Tri-Residual Gated Encoder作为轻量级的探针架构，用于抑制模式噪声并放大问题-模式不匹配的稀疏局部线索。

Conclusion: LatentRefusal提供了一种附加的安全层，适用于文本到SQL系统，展示了其在确保系统安全性和准确性方面的有效性。

Abstract: In LLM-based text-to-SQL systems, unanswerable and underspecified user queries may generate not only incorrect text but also executable programs that yield misleading results or violate safety constraints, posing a major barrier to safe deployment. Existing refusal strategies for such queries either rely on output-level instruction following, which is brittle due to model hallucinations, or estimate output uncertainty, which adds complexity and overhead. To address this challenge, we formalize safe refusal in text-to-SQL systems as an answerability-gating problem and propose LatentRefusal, a latent-signal refusal mechanism that predicts query answerability from intermediate hidden activations of a large language model. We introduce the Tri-Residual Gated Encoder, a lightweight probing architecture, to suppress schema noise and amplify sparse, localized cues of question-schema mismatch that indicate unanswerability. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse ambiguous and unanswerable settings, together with ablation studies and interpretability analyses, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that LatentRefusal provides an attachable and efficient safety layer for text-to-SQL systems. Across four benchmarks, LatentRefusal improves average F1 to 88.5 percent on both backbones while adding approximately 2 milliseconds of probe overhead.

Method: ErrEval 通过引入两个阶段的过程来提高评估精度：第一阶段，使用轻量级的可插拔错误识别器检测和分类常见的结构、语言和内容方面的错误；第二阶段，将这些诊断信号作为显性证据，指导LLM评估器做出更细致和现实的判断。

Result: 在三个基准测试集上的大量实验表明，ErrEval 将显式诊断整合进评估能更好地与人类判断一致，并且有效地减少了对低质量问题的误估。

Conclusion: ErrEval 提供了一种能够提升问答生成评估准确性的框架，并证明了其在减少低质量问题误估的有效性。

Abstract: Automatic Question Generation (QG) often produces outputs with critical defects, such as factual hallucinations and answer mismatches. However, existing evaluation methods, including LLM-based evaluators, mainly adopt a black-box and holistic paradigm without explicit error modeling, leading to the neglect of such defects and overestimation of question quality. To address this issue, we propose ErrEval, a flexible and Error-aware Evaluation framework that enhances QG evaluation through explicit error diagnostics. Specifically, ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process of error diagnosis followed by informed scoring. At the first stage, a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects. These diagnostic signals are then incorporated as explicit evidence to guide LLM evaluators toward more fine-grained and grounded judgments. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ErrEval, showing that incorporating explicit diagnostics improves alignment with human judgments. Further analyses confirm that ErrEval effectively mitigates the overestimation of low-quality questions.

Abstract: Privacy policies help inform people about organisations' personal data processing practices, covering different aspects such as data collection, data storage, and sharing of personal data with third parties. Privacy policies are often difficult for people to fully comprehend due to the lengthy and complex legal language used and inconsistent practices across different sectors and organisations. To help conduct automated and large-scale analyses of privacy policies, many researchers have studied applications of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including large language models (LLMs). While a limited number of prior studies utilised LLMs for extracting personal data flows from privacy policies, our approach builds on this line of work by combining LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customised knowledge base derived from existing studies. This paper presents the development of LADFA, an end-to-end computational framework, which can process unstructured text in a given privacy policy, extract personal data flows and construct a personal data flow graph, and conduct analysis of the data flow graph to facilitate insight discovery. The framework consists of a pre-processor, an LLM-based processor, and a data flow post-processor. We demonstrated and validated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach by conducting a case study that involved examining ten selected privacy policies from the automotive industry. Moreover, it is worth noting that LADFA is designed to be flexible and customisable, making it suitable for a range of text-based analysis tasks beyond privacy policy analysis.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is critical, yet traditional fine-tuning methods are computationally expensive and inflexible. While test-time alignment offers a promising alternative, existing approaches often rely on distorted trajectory-level signals or inefficient sampling, fundamentally capping performance and failing to preserve the generative diversity of the base model. This paper introduces LLMdoctor, a novel framework for efficient test-time alignment that operates via a patient-doctor paradigm. It integrates token-level reward acquisition with token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO) to steer a large, frozen patient LLM with a smaller, specialized doctor model. Unlike conventional methods that rely on trajectory-level rewards, LLMdoctor first extracts fine-grained, token-level preference signals from the patient model's behavioral variations. These signals then guide the training of the doctor model via TFPO, which establishes flow consistency across all subtrajectories, enabling precise token-by-token alignment while inherently preserving generation diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMdoctor significantly outperforms existing test-time alignment methods and even surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning approaches like DPO.

Abstract: Although the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) dominate industrial tabular applications, upgrading legacy models in high-concurrency production environments still faces prohibitive retraining costs and systemic risks. To address this problem, we present NSR-Boost, a neuro-symbolic residual boosting framework designed specifically for industrial scenarios. Its core advantage lies in being "non-intrusive". It treats the legacy model as a frozen model and performs targeted repairs on "hard regions" where predictions fail. The framework comprises three key stages: first, finding hard regions through residuals, then generating interpretable experts by generating symbolic code structures using Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning parameters using Bayesian optimization, and finally dynamically integrating experts with legacy model output through a lightweight aggregator. We report on the successful deployment of NSR-Boost within the core financial risk control system at Qfin Holdings. This framework not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across six public datasets and one private dataset, more importantly, shows excellent performance gains on real-world online data. In conclusion, it effectively captures long-tail risks missed by traditional models and offers a safe, low-cost evolutionary paradigm for industry.

Abstract: With advancements in deep learning (DL) and computer vision techniques, the field of chart understanding is evolving rapidly. In particular, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are proving to be efficient and accurate in understanding charts. To accurately measure the performance of MLLMs, the research community has developed multiple datasets to serve as benchmarks. By examining these datasets, we found that they are all limited to a small set of chart types. To bridge this gap, we propose the ChartComplete dataset. The dataset is based on a chart taxonomy borrowed from the visualization community, and it covers thirty different chart types. The dataset is a collection of classified chart images and does not include a learning signal. We present the ChartComplete dataset as is to the community to build upon it.

Abstract: Domain-specific knowledge graphs (DKGs) often lack coverage compared to general knowledge graphs (GKGs). To address this, we introduce Domain-specific Knowledge Graph Fusion (DKGF), a novel task that enriches DKGs by integrating relevant facts from GKGs. DKGF faces two key challenges: high ambiguity in domain relevance and misalignment in knowledge granularity across graphs. We propose ExeFuse, a simple yet effective Fact-as-Program paradigm. It treats each GKG fact as a latent semantic program, maps abstract relations to granularity-aware operators, and verifies domain relevance via program executability on the target DKG. This unified probabilistic framework jointly resolves relevance and granularity issues. We construct two benchmarks, DKGF(W-I) and DKGF(Y-I), with 21 evaluation configurations. Extensive experiments validate the task's importance and our model's effectiveness, providing the first standardized testbed for DKGF.

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, widely deployed in consequential contexts, and efficacious in bringing about real-world impacts, ensuring that their decisions are not only instrumentally effective but also normatively aligned has become critical. We introduce a neuro-symbolic reason-based containment architecture, Governor for Reason-Aligned ContainmEnt (GRACE), that decouples normative reasoning from instrumental decision-making and can contain AI agents of virtually any design. GRACE restructures decision-making into three modules: a Moral Module (MM) that determines permissible macro actions via deontic logic-based reasoning; a Decision-Making Module (DMM) that encapsulates the target agent while selecting instrumentally optimal primitive actions in accordance with derived macro actions; and a Guard that monitors and enforces moral compliance. The MM uses a reason-based formalism providing a semantic foundation for deontic logic, enabling interpretability, contestability, and justifiability. Its symbolic representation enriches the DMM's informational context and supports formal verification and statistical guarantees of alignment enforced by the Guard. We demonstrate GRACE on an example of a LLM therapy assistant, showing how it enables stakeholders to understand, contest, and refine agent behavior.

Abstract: The practice of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved state-of-the-art performance on specialized tasks, yet diagnosing why these models become brittle and fail to generalize remains a critical open problem. To address this, we introduce and apply a multi-layered diagnostic framework to a cross-architectural study. We fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral models on a high-stakes phishing detection task and use SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability to uncover the root causes of their generalization failures. Our investigation reveals three critical findings: (1) Generalization is driven by a powerful synergy between architecture and data diversity. The Gemma 2 9B model achieves state-of-the-art performance (>91\% F1), but only when trained on a stylistically diverse ``generalist'' dataset. (2) Generalization is highly architecture-dependent. We diagnose a specific failure mode in Llama 3.1 8B, which performs well on a narrow domain but cannot integrate diverse data, leading to a significant performance drop. (3) Some architectures are inherently more generalizable. The Mistral model proves to be a consistent and resilient performer across multiple training paradigms. By pinpointing the flawed heuristics responsible for these failures, our work provides a concrete methodology for diagnosing and understanding generalization failures, underscoring that reliable AI requires deep validation of the interplay between architecture, data, and training strategy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has produced substantial gains in reasoning, perception, and generative capability across language and vision. However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across natural language tasks and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: In this article, we argue that understanding the collective behavior of agents based on large language models (LLMs) is an essential area of inquiry, with important implications in terms of risks and benefits, impacting us as a society at many levels. We claim that the distinctive nature of LLMs--namely, their initialization with extensive pre-trained knowledge and implicit social priors, together with their capability of adaptation through in-context learning--motivates the need for an interactionist paradigm consisting of alternative theoretical foundations, methodologies, and analytical tools, in order to systematically examine how prior knowledge and embedded values interact with social context to shape emergent phenomena in multi-agent generative AI systems. We propose and discuss four directions that we consider crucial for the development and deployment of LLM-based collectives, focusing on theory, methods, and trans-disciplinary dialogue.

Abstract: Comprehending genomic information is essential for biomedical research, yet extracting data from complex distributed databases remains challenging. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for genomic Question Answering (QA) but face limitations due to restricted access to domain-specific databases. GeneGPT is the current state-of-the-art system that enhances LLMs by utilizing specialized API calls, though it is constrained by rigid API dependencies and limited adaptability. We replicate GeneGPT and propose GenomAgent, a multi-agent framework that efficiently coordinates specialized agents for complex genomics queries. Evaluated on nine tasks from the GeneTuring benchmark, GenomAgent outperforms GeneGPT by 12% on average, and its flexible architecture extends beyond genomics to various scientific domains needing expert knowledge extraction.

Conclusion: 研究成果展示了一种高效处理多属性LTLf合成问题的新方法，对自动化系统的设计与实现具有重要意义。

Abstract: We study LTLf synthesis with multiple properties, where satisfying all properties may be impossible. Instead of enumerating subsets of properties, we compute in one fixed-point computation the relation between product-game states and the goal sets that are realizable from them, and we synthesize strategies achieving maximal realizable sets. We develop a fully symbolic algorithm that introduces Boolean goal variables and exploits monotonicity to represent exponentially many goal combinations compactly. Our approach substantially outperforms enumeration-based baselines, with speedups of up to two orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Hierarchical reasoning model (HRM) achieves extraordinary performance on various reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming large language model-based reasoners. To understand the strengths and potential failure modes of HRM, we conduct a mechanistic study on its reasoning patterns and find three surprising facts: (a) Failure of extremely simple puzzles, e.g., HRM can fail on a puzzle with only one unknown cell. We attribute this failure to the violation of the fixed point property, a fundamental assumption of HRM. (b) "Grokking" dynamics in reasoning steps, i.e., the answer is not improved uniformly, but instead there is a critical reasoning step that suddenly makes the answer correct; (c) Existence of multiple fixed points. HRM "guesses" the first fixed point, which could be incorrect, and gets trapped there for a while or forever. All facts imply that HRM appears to be "guessing" instead of "reasoning". Leveraging this "guessing" picture, we propose three strategies to scale HRM's guesses: data augmentation (scaling the quality of guesses), input perturbation (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging inference randomness), and model bootstrapping (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging training randomness). On the practical side, by combining all methods, we develop Augmented HRM, boosting accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme from 54.5% to 96.9%. On the scientific side, our analysis provides new insights into how reasoning models "reason".

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) contexts are typically constructed using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which involves ranking and selecting the top-k passages. The approach causes fragmentation in information graphs in document structures, over-retrieval, and duplication of content alongside insufficient query context, including 2nd and 3rd order facets. In this paper, a structure-informed and diversity-constrained context bubble construction framework is proposed that assembles coherent, citable bundles of spans under a strict token budget. The method preserves and exploits inherent document structure by organising multi-granular spans (e.g., sections and rows) and using task-conditioned structural priors to guide retrieval. Starting from high-relevance anchor spans, a context bubble is constructed through constrained selection that balances query relevance, marginal coverage, and redundancy penalties. It will explicitly constrain diversity and budget, producing compact and informative context sets, unlike top-k retrieval. Moreover, a full retrieval is emitted that traces the scoring and selection choices of the records, thus providing auditability and deterministic tuning. Experiments on enterprise documents demonstrate the efficiency of context bubble as it significantly reduces redundant context, is better able to cover secondary facets and has a better answer quality and citation faithfulness within a limited context window. Ablation studies demonstrate that both structural priors as well as diversity constraint selection are necessary; removing either component results in a decline in coverage and an increase in redundant or incomplete context.

Abstract: Our study examines how generative AI (GenAI) influences performance, creative self-efficacy, and cognitive load in architectural conceptual design tasks. Thirty-six student participants from Architectural Engineering and other disciplines completed a two-phase architectural design task, first independently and then with external tools (GenAI-assisted condition and control condition using an online repository of existing architectural projects). Design outcomes were evaluated by expert raters, while self-efficacy and cognitive load were self-reported after each phase. Difference-in-differences analyses revealed no overall performance advantage of GenAI across participants; however, subgroup analyses showed that GenAI significantly improved design performance for novice designers. In contrast, general creative self-efficacy declined for students using GenAI. Cognitive load did not differ significantly between conditions, though prompt usage patterns showed that iterative idea generation and visual feedback prompts were linked to greater reductions in cognitive load. These findings suggest that GenAI effectiveness depends on users' prior expertise and interaction strategies through prompting.

TL;DR: SparseLUT提出了一种综合框架，通过对LUT大小进行架构增强以及引入非贪婪训练算法来优化神经元连接性，显著降低了LUT消耗并减少了推理延迟，同时保持了竞争力的准确率。

Motivation: 现有基于LUT的DNNs如LogicNets、PolyLUT和NeuraLUT面临LUT大小指数增长和随机稀疏连接效率低下的挑战。

Method: SparseLUT通过架构增强降低LUT大小并减少推理延迟，同时提出非贪婪训练算法选择性地修剪不重要的输入并有选择地生长更有用的输入以优化神经元连接性。

Result: 相比现有LUT-DNN方法，SparseLUT在MNIST上提高了2.13%的准确率，在Jet Substructure Classification上提高了0.94%的准确率，同时减少了LUT消耗并降低了推理延迟。

Conclusion: SparseLUT提供了一种有效的方法来缓解基于LUT的DNNs中的关键挑战，展示了在保持高精度的同时提高资源利用率和减少性能延迟的潜力。

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices such as FPGAs requires a careful balance among latency, power, and hardware resource usage, while maintaining high accuracy. Existing Lookup Table (LUT)-based DNNs -- such as LogicNets, PolyLUT, and NeuraLUT -- face two critical challenges: the exponential growth of LUT size and inefficient random sparse connectivity. This paper presents SparseLUT, a comprehensive framework that addresses these challenges through two orthogonal optimizations. First, we propose an architectural enhancement that aggregates multiple PolyLUT sub-neurons via an adder, significantly reducing LUT consumption by 2.0x-13.9x and lowering inference latency by 1.2x-1.6x, all while maintaining comparable accuracy. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce a non-greedy training algorithm that optimizes neuron connectivity by selectively pruning less significant inputs and strategically regrowing more effective ones. This training optimization, which incurs no additional area and latency overhead, delivers consistent accuracy improvements across benchmarks -- achieving up to a 2.13% gain on MNIST and 0.94% on Jet Substructure Classification compared to existing LUT-DNN approaches.
