Given such trends, design space exploration (DSE) at early stages is critical to ensure agile development towards optimal performance and cost. Industry-grade EDA tools directly take in RTL code and report accurate results, but do not perform DSE. Recent works have attempted to explore the design space via simulation. However, most of these works are domain-specific and constrain the space that users are allowed to explore, offering limited flexibility between technologies, architecture, and applications. Moreover, they often demand high domain expertise to ensure high accuracy. To enable simulation that is agnostic to technology, architecture, and application at any granularity, we introduce Architecture-Graph (Agraph), a graph that unifies the system representation surrounding any arbitrary application, software, architecture, and circuit. Such a unified representation distinguishes Agraph from prior works, which focus on a single stack, allowing users to freely explore the design space across system stacks. To fully unleash the potential of Agraph, we further present Archx, a framework that implements Agraph. Archx is user-friendly in two ways. First, Archx has an easy-to-use programming interface to automatically generate and sweep design points under user constraints, boosting the programmability. Second, Archx adopts scope-based metric retrieval to analyze and understand each design point at any user-preferred hierarchy, enhancing the explainability. We conduct case studies that demonstrate Agraph's generalization across technologies, architecture, and applications with high simulation accuracy. Overall, we argue that Agraph and Archx serve as a foundation to simulate both performance and cost at will.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAgraph\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u4efb\u610f\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u8f6f\u4ef6\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e0a\u81ea\u7531\u63a2\u7d22\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u4fbf\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Archx\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u70b9\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86Agraph\u7684\u8de8\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u4eff\u771f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5927\u548c\u590d\u6742\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5feb\u901f\u5f00\u53d1\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Agraph\u548cArchx\u3002", "method": "Agraph\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u81ea\u7531\u63a2\u7d22\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002Archx\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8bbe\u8ba1\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86Agraph\u548cArchx\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u5173\u6ce8\u6280\u672f\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4eff\u771f\u3002", "conclusion": "Agraph\u548cArchx\u4e3a\u7075\u6d3b\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4eff\u771f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

To address the issue, one effective and well studied technique is cache prefetching. Many prefetching designs have been proposed, with varying approaches and effectiveness. For example, SPP is a popular prefetcher that leverages confidence throttled recursion to speculate on the future path of program's references, however it is very susceptible to the reference reordering of higher-level caches and the OoO core. Orthogonally, AMPM is another popular approach to prefetching which uses reordering-resistant access maps to identify patterns within a region, but is unable to speculate beyond that region. In this paper, we propose SPPAM, a new approach to prefetching, inspired by prior works such as SPP and AMPM, while addressing their limitations. SPPAM utilizes online-learning to build a set of access-map patterns. These patterns are used in a speculative lookahead which is throttled by a confidence metric.

Many prompting techniques have been developed to assist with LLM reasoning, notably Chain-of-Thought (CoT); however, these techniques, too, have come under scrutiny as LLMs' ability to reason at all has come into question. Borrowing from the domain of cognitive and educational science, this paper investigates whether the Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) framework can improve LLM reasoning capabilities beyond its previously demonstrated success in educational applications. The TMK framework's unique ability to capture causal, teleological, and hierarchical reasoning structures, combined with its explicit task decomposition mechanisms, makes it particularly well-suited for addressing language model reasoning deficiencies, and unlike other hierarchical frameworks such as HTN and BDI, TMK provides explicit representations of not just what to do and how to do it, but also why actions are taken. The study evaluates TMK by experimenting on the PlanBench benchmark, focusing on the Blocksworld domain to test for reasoning and planning capabilities, examining whether TMK-structured prompting can help language models better decompose complex planning problems into manageable sub-tasks. Results also highlight significant performance inversion in reasoning models. TMK prompting enables the reasoning model to achieve up to an accuracy of 97.3\\% on opaque, symbolic tasks (Random versions of Blocksworld in PlanBench) where it previously failed (31.5\\%), suggesting the potential to bridge the gap between semantic approximation and symbolic manipulation. Our findings suggest that TMK functions not merely as context, but also as a mechanism that steers reasoning models away from their default linguistic modes to engage formal, code-execution pathways in the context of the experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7Task-Method-Knowledge\uff08TMK\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u8f85\u52a9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728Blocksworld\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0TMK\u4f7fLLM\u5728\u5148\u524d\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u8c1c\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8697.3%\uff0c\u8868\u660eTMK\u80fd\u591f\u6539\u5584LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u7b49\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5e2e\u52a9LLM\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5df2\u7ecf\u6709\u6240\u6210\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u8d28\u7591\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK)\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5426\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7PlanBench\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u7684Blocksworld\u9886\u57df\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5LLM\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9LLM\u4f7f\u7528TMK\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728PlanBench\u4e2d\u7684Blocksworld\u73af\u5883\u91cc\uff0c\u539f\u672c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7TMK\u63d0\u793a\u540e\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8697.3%\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660eTMK\u5728\u5f25\u8865\u8bed\u4e49\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTMK\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u4ece\u9ed8\u8ba4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u5411\u7f16\u7801\u6267\u884c\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

We study how the linguistic characteristics of clinical decisions vary across decision categories and whether these differences explain extraction failures. Using MedDec discharge summaries annotated with decision categories from the Decision Identification and Classification Taxonomy for Use in Medicine (DICTUM), we compute seven linguistic indices for each decision span and analyze span-level extraction recall of a standard transformer model. We find clear category-specific signatures: drug-related and problem-defining decisions are entity-dense and telegraphic, whereas advice and precaution decisions contain more narrative, with higher stopword and pronoun proportions and more frequent hedging and negation cues. On the validation split, exact-match recall is 48%, with large gaps across linguistic strata: recall drops from 58% to 24% from the lowest to highest stopword-proportion bins, and spans containing hedging or negation cues are less likely to be recovered. Under a relaxed overlap-based match criterion, recall increases to 71%, indicating that many errors are span boundary disagreements rather than complete misses. Overall, narrative-style spans--common in advice and precaution decisions--are a consistent blind spot under exact matching, suggesting that downstream systems should incorporate boundary-tolerant evaluation and extraction strategies for clinical decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u51b3\u7b56\u7c7b\u522b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u53d6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u6709\u51b3\u7b56\u7c7b\u522b\u7684MedDec\u51fa\u9662\u603b\u7ed3\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u8de8\u5ea6\u7684\u4e03\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u4e0b\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fb9\u754c\u5bb9\u5fcd\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u9762\u5411\u7684\u62a4\u7406\u603b\u7ed3\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\u662f\u63d0\u53d6\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u6587\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MedDec\u51fa\u9662\u603b\u7ed3\u6ce8\u89e3\u5e26\u51b3\u7b56\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u8de8\u5ea6\u7684\u4e03\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6807\u51c6\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u653e\u5bbd\u5339\u914d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u5177\u6709\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u836f\u7269\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5b9e\u4f53\u5bc6\u96c6\u548c\u7535\u62a5\u5f0f\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u5efa\u8bae\u548c\u9884\u9632\u63aa\u65bd\u5305\u542b\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u505c\u7528\u8bcd\u548c\u4ee3\u8bcd\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u4e0b\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e3a48%\uff0c\u5728\u505c\u7528\u8bcd\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6700\u4f4e\u5230\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u533a\u95f4\u5185\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4ece58%\u4e0b\u964d\u523024%\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u5426\u5b9a\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u6bb5\u843d\u66f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6062\u590d\u3002\u653e\u5bbd\u5339\u914d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e3a71%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8bb8\u591a\u9519\u8bef\u662f\u8de8\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5206\u6b67\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u9519\u8fc7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d9\u4e8b\u578b\u6bb5\u843d\u2014\u2014\u5728\u5efa\u8bae\u548c\u9884\u9632\u63aa\u65bd\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u8f83\u4e3a\u5e38\u89c1\u2014\u2014\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u4e0b\u662f\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u76f2\u70b9\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e0b\u6e38\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u5f53\u5f15\u5165\u8fb9\u754c\u5bb9\u5fcd\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

However, current progress remains fragmented, lacking a unified view of the underlying mechanisms, protection paradigms, and robustness challenges. To address this gap, we present the first systematic survey on 3DGS IP protection and introduce a bottom-up framework that examines (i) underlying Gaussian-based perturbation mechanisms, (ii) passive and active protection paradigms, and (iii) robustness threats under emerging generative AI era, revealing gaps in technical foundations and robustness characterization and indicating opportunities for deeper investigation.

Quantization is an effective solution, with INT weights and FP activations being widely adopted to preserve accuracy. Prior works further reduce FP overhead by using block floating point (BFP) activations in linear layers, but fail to extend BFP to attention layers due to severe accuracy degradation, limiting overall efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose Harmonia, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework that enables all-layer BFP activations with a configurable hardware architecture. First, we systematically explore BFP configurations to achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and activation compression across all layers. Second, to reduce KV-cache storage and computation in attention layers, we introduce an asymmetric bit-allocation strategy and computations in attention layers,we introduce an asymmetric bit-allocation strategy combined with a hybrid offline-online outlier smoothing technique. This allow aggressive KV-cache compression from FP16 to 4-bit-mantissa BFP with only 0.3% average accuracy loss. Third, to fully exploit all-layer BFP activations, we design dedicated hardware components, including a reconfigurable PE supporting mixed data formats (BFP-INT and BPF-BFP), a real-time FP16-to-BFP converter, and a tiling-aware dataflow to reduce memory traffic. We evaluate Harmonia on GEMM operations in both linear and attention layers across eight widely used LLMs. Compared with prior works, Harmonia achieves 3.84x (up to 5.05x) higher area efficiency, 2.03x (up to 3.90x) better energy efficiency, and 3.08x (up to 4.62x) speedup on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "Harmonia \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5-\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u652f\u6301\u6240\u6709\u5c42\u7684 BFP \u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22 BFP \u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11 KV \u7f13\u5b58\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5b9a\u786c\u4ef6\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u7ecf\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5757\u6d6e\u70b9\u6570\uff08BFP\uff09\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6765\u51cf\u8f7bFP\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u5230\u4e86\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cf\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u635f\u5931\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u74f6\u9888\uff0cHarmonia \u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7efc\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6240\u6709\u5c42\u7684 BFP \u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "Harmonia \u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22 BFP \u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684 KV \u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e13\u4e3a\u652f\u6301 BFP-INT \u548c BFP-BFP \u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u5904\u7406\u5355\u5143 (PE)\uff0c FP16 \u5230 BFP \u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u4ee5\u53ca\u9488\u5bf9\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\u6d41\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u3002", "result": "Harmonia \u5728\u516b\u79cd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684 LLMs \u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u7684 GEMM \u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863.84\u500d (\u6700\u591a5.05\u500d) \u7684\u9762\u79ef\u6548\u7387\uff0c2.03\u500d (\u6700\u591a3.90\u500d) \u7684\u80fd\u6548\u6bd4\u4ee5\u53ca3.08\u500d (\u6700\u591a4.62\u500d) \u7684\u5e73\u5747\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "Harmonia \u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u9762\u79ef\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper proposes AgentArk, a novel framework to distill multi-agent dynamics into the weights of a single model, effectively transforming explicit test-time interactions into implicit model capabilities. This equips a single agent with the intelligence of multi-agent systems while remaining computationally efficient. Specifically, we investigate three hierarchical distillation strategies across various models, tasks, scaling, and scenarios: reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning; trajectory-based augmentation; and process-aware distillation. By shifting the burden of computation from inference to training, the distilled models preserve the efficiency of one agent while exhibiting strong reasoning and self-correction performance of multiple agents. They further demonstrate enhanced robustness and generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. We hope this work can shed light on future research on efficient and robust multi-agent development.

This comes with two potential limitations: the need to design the reward, and the potentially sparse nature of binary rewards. Here, we systematically investigate rewards derived from the probability or log-probability of emitting the reference answer (or any other prompt continuation present in the data), which have the advantage of not relying on specific verifiers and being available at scale. Several recent works have advocated for the use of similar rewards (e.g., VeriFree, JEPO, RLPR, NOVER). We systematically compare variants of likelihood-based rewards with standard baselines, testing performance both on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and on long-form answers where no external verifier is available. We find that using the log-probability of the reference answer as the reward for chain-of-thought (CoT) learning is the only option that performs well in all setups. This reward is also consistent with the next-token log-likelihood loss used during pretraining. In verifiable settings, log-probability rewards bring comparable or better success rates than reinforcing with standard binary rewards, and yield much better perplexity. In non-verifiable settings, they perform on par with SFT. On the other hand, methods based on probability, such as VeriFree, flatline on non-verifiable settings due to vanishing probabilities of getting the correct answer. Overall, this establishes log-probability rewards as a viable method for CoT fine-tuning, bridging the short, verifiable and long, non-verifiable answer settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u8003\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u5730\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ec6\u7a76\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u4e8c\u5143\u5956\u52b1\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53c2\u8003\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6982\u7387\u6216\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u6d3e\u751f\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6ca1\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u7684\u957f\u5f62\u5f0f\u7b54\u6848\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u8003\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5956\u52b1\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u7b56\u7565\u8c03\u6574\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u603b\u4e4b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u8003\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u77ed\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u957f\u7684\u975e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u95ee\u7b54\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u7684\u8c03\u4f18\u3002"}}

But what about contexts that are not novel but merely infrequent? In hierarchical regression, the model's predictions for behavior in a context are affected by observations from other similar contexts to the extent that 1) the current context is infrequent and 2) different contexts behave similarly. This is called adaptive partial pooling of evidence. This paper shows that next-word predictions of a transformer (GPT2) are increasingly unaffected by observations from outside the current context across epochs of training (the amount of pooling reduces with training), and that the extent of pooling is affected by context frequency, context number (type frequency) and context variability in a similar way to hierarchical regression. These characteristics of learning in transformers are argued to be realistic on both rational and empirical grounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u53d8\u5206\u53d8\u538b\u5668\uff08GPT2\uff09\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u968f\u7740\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8fdb\u884c\u9010\u6e10\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53d7\u5f53\u524d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9891\u7387\u3001\u7c7b\u578b\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53d8\u5316\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u975e\u65b0\u9896\u4f46\u9891\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc1\u660e\u53d8\u5206\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u6027\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u53d8\u5206\u53d8\u538b\u5668\uff08GPT2\uff09\u968f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9891\u7387\u3001\u7c7b\u578b\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53d8\u5316\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d8\u5206\u53d8\u538b\u5668\uff08GPT2\uff09\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u9010\u6e10\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53d7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9891\u7387\u3001\u7c7b\u578b\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53d8\u5316\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d8\u5206\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u6027\u5728\u7406\u6027\u4e0a\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\u90fd\u662f\u5408\u7406\u7684\u3002"}}

This paper identifies limitations in this methodology that, depending on the exact setup, can lead to both underestimating and overestimating the similarity of value orientation. Using the World Value Survey in three languages across five countries, we demonstrate that prompting methods (direct vs. chain-of-thought) and decoding strategies (greedy vs. sampling) significantly affect results. To assess the interaction between answers, we introduce a novel metric, self-correlation distance. This metric measures whether LLMs maintain consistent relationships between answers across different questions, as humans do. This indicates that even a high average agreement with human data, when considering LLM responses independently, does not guarantee structural alignment in responses. Additionally, we reveal a weak correlation between two common evaluation metrics, mean-squared distance and KL divergence, which assume that survey answers are independent of each other.

Recent work has reported that monitorability--the degree to which CoT faithfully and informatively reflects internal computation--can appear as a \"free gift\" during the early stages of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We make this observation concrete through a systematic evaluation across model families and training domains. Our results show that this effect is not universal: monitorability improvements are strongly data-dependent. In particular, we demonstrate the critical role of data diversity and instruction-following data during RLVR training. We further show that monitorability is orthogonal to capability--improvements in reasoning performance do not imply increased transparency. Through mechanistic analysis, we attribute monitorability gains primarily to response distribution sharpening (entropy reduction) and increased attention to the prompt, rather than stronger causal reliance on reasoning traces. We also reveal how monitorability dynamics vary with controlled training and evaluation difficulty.

Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most effective for this unique and highly general transfer task? We give evidence that the correspondence between speech and language models and the brain derives from shared meaning abstraction and not their next-word prediction properties. In particular, models construct higher-order linguistic features in their middle layers, cued by a peak in the layerwise intrinsic dimension, a measure of feature complexity. We show that a layer's intrinsic dimension strongly predicts how well it explains fMRI and ECoG signals; that the relation between intrinsic dimension and brain predictivity arises over model pre-training; and finetuning models to better predict the brain causally increases both representations' intrinsic dimension and their semantic content. Results suggest that semantic richness, high intrinsic dimension, and brain predictivity mirror each other, and that the key driver of model-brain similarity is rich meaning abstraction of the inputs, where language modeling is a task sufficiently complex (but perhaps not the only) to require it.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u8111\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u523a\u6fc0\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u548c\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5927\u8111\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6210\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u4e3a\u4f55\u6bd4\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u8111\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u523a\u6fc0\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u5c42\u95f4\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5c42\u95f4\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u5927\u8111\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0efMRI\u548cECoG\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u91ca\u5ea6\u6709\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u3001\u9ad8\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u5927\u8111\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u662f\u76f8\u4e92\u955c\u50cf\u7684\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u662f\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8db3\u591f\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u6765\u8981\u6c42\u5b83\u3002"}}

However, existing methods primarily focus on static objects, while understanding dynamic point cloud sequences remains largely unexplored. This limitation is mainly caused by the lack of large-scale cross-modal datasets and the difficulty of modeling motions in spatio-temporal contexts. To bridge this gap, we present 4DPC$^2$hat, the first MLLM tailored for dynamic point cloud understanding. To this end, we construct a large-scale cross-modal dataset 4DPC$^2$hat-200K via a meticulous two-stage pipeline consisting of topology-consistent 4D point construction and two-level captioning. The dataset contains over 44K dynamic object sequences, 700K point cloud frames, and 200K curated question-answer (QA) pairs, supporting inquiries about counting, temporal relationship, action, spatial relationship, and appearance. At the core of the framework, we introduce a Mamba-enhanced temporal reasoning MLLM to capture long-range dependencies and dynamic patterns among a point cloud sequence. Furthermore, we propose a failure-aware bootstrapping learning strategy that iteratively identifies model deficiencies and generates targeted QA supervision to continuously strengthen corresponding reasoning capabilities.

Yet modern AI systems increasingly operate within human decision loops, where users interpret and act on model recommendations. Large Language Models generate fluent natural-language explanations that shape how users perceive and trust AI outputs, revealing a new attack surface at the cognitive layer: the communication channel between AI and its users. We introduce adversarial explanation attacks (AEAs), where an attacker manipulates the framing of LLM-generated explanations to modulate human trust in incorrect outputs. We formalize this behavioral threat through the trust miscalibration gap, a metric that captures the difference in human trust between correct and incorrect outputs under adversarial explanations. By incorporating this gap, AEAs explore the daunting threats in which persuasive explanations reinforce users' trust in incorrect predictions. To characterize this threat, we conducted a controlled experiment (n = 205), systematically varying four dimensions of explanation framing: reasoning mode, evidence type, communication style, and presentation format. Our findings show that users report nearly identical trust for adversarial and benign explanations, with adversarial explanations preserving the vast majority of benign trust despite being incorrect. The most vulnerable cases arise when AEAs closely resemble expert communication, combining authoritative evidence, neutral tone, and domain-appropriate reasoning. Vulnerability is highest on hard tasks, in fact-driven domains, and among participants who are less formally educated, younger, or highly trusting of AI.

In MoE models, each token is routed to a subset of expert subnetworks; we show these routing decisions leak substantially more information than previously understood. Prior work using logistic regression achieves limited reconstruction; we show that a 3-layer MLP improves this to 63.1% top-1 accuracy, and that a transformer-based sequence decoder recovers 91.2% of tokens top-1 (94.8% top-10) on 32-token sequences from OpenWebText after training on 100M tokens. These results connect MoE routing to the broader literature on embedding inversion.

Beyond generating segmentation masks, providing rich and interpretable diagnoses of mask quality remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Mask Quality Assessment in the Ref-AVS context (MQA-RefAVS), a new task that evaluates the quality of candidate segmentation masks without relying on ground-truth annotations as references at inference time. Given audio-visual-language inputs and each provided segmentation mask, the task requires estimating its IoU with the unobserved ground truth, identifying the corresponding error type, and recommending an actionable quality-control decision. To support this task, we construct MQ-RAVSBench, a benchmark featuring diverse and representative mask error modes that span both geometric and semantic issues. We further propose MQ-Auditor, a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based auditor that explicitly reasons over multimodal cues and mask information to produce quantitative and qualitative mask quality assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MQ-Auditor outperforms strong open-source and commercial MLLMs and can be integrated with existing Ref-AVS systems to detect segmentation failures and support downstream segmentation improvement.

Counterfactuals have emerged as one of the most compelling forms of explanation. They address ``why not'' questions by revealing how decisions could be altered. Despite the growing literature, most existing explainers focus on a single type of counterfactual and are restricted to local explanations, focusing on individual instances. There has been no systematic study of alternative counterfactual types, nor of global counterfactuals that shed light on a system's overall reasoning process.\n  This paper addresses the two gaps by introducing an axiomatic framework built on a set of desirable properties for counterfactual explainers. It proves impossibility theorems showing that no single explainer can satisfy certain axiom combinations simultaneously, and fully characterizes all compatible sets. Representation theorems then establish five one-to-one correspondences between specific subsets of axioms and the families of explainers that satisfy them.

In this work, we proposed an ultrafast IR method for 3D PACT, called Gaussian-kernel-based Ultrafast 3D Photoacoustic Iterative Reconstruction (GPAIR), which achieves orders-of-magnitude acceleration in computing. GPAIR transforms traditional spatial grids with continuous isotropic Gaussian kernels. By deriving analytical closed-form expression for pressure waves and implementing powerful GPU-accelerated differentiable Triton operators, GPAIR demonstrates extraordinary ultrafast sub-second reconstruction speed for 3D targets containing 8.4 million voxels in animal experiments.

This paper asks what signals drive LVC classification by systematically restricting model inputs. Using UD-derived supervision, we compare lemma-driven baselines (lemma TF--IDF + Logistic Regression; BERTurk trained on lemma sequences), a grammar-only Logistic Regression over UD morphosyntax (UPOS/DEPREL/MORPH), and a full-input BERTurk baseline. We evaluate on a controlled diagnostic set with Random negatives, lexical controls (NLVC), and LVC positives, reporting split-wise performance to expose decision-boundary behavior. Results show that coarse morphosyntax alone is insufficient for robust LVC detection under controlled contrasts, while lexical identity supports LVC judgments but is sensitive to calibration and normalization choices.

This study investigates whether state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) foundation models can reduce thousands of unlabeled animal images directly to species-level clusters. We present a comprehensive benchmarking framework evaluating five ViT models combined with five dimensionality reduction techniques and four clustering algorithms, two supervised and two unsupervised, across 60 species (30 mammals and 30 birds), with each test using a random subset of 200 validated images per species. We investigate when clustering succeeds at species-level, where it fails, and whether clustering within the species-level reveals ecologically meaningful patterns such as sex, age, or phenotypic variation. Our results demonstrate near-perfect species-level clustering (V-measure: 0.958) using DINOv3 embeddings with t-SNE and supervised hierarchical clustering methods. Unsupervised approaches achieve competitive performance (0.943) while requiring no prior species knowledge, rejecting only 1.14% of images as outliers requiring expert review. We further demonstrate robustness to realistic long-tailed distributions of species and show that intentional over-clustering can reliably extract intra-specific variation including age classes, sexual dimorphism, and pelage differences.

In contrast, safety risks emerging during training remain largely unexplored. Beyond explicit reward hacking that directly manipulates explicit reward functions in reinforcement learning, we study implicit training-time safety risks: harmful behaviors driven by a model's internal incentives and contextual background information. For example, during code-based reinforcement learning, a model may covertly manipulate logged accuracy for self-preservation. We present the first systematic study of this problem, introducing a taxonomy with five risk levels, ten fine-grained risk categories, and three incentive types. Extensive experiments reveal the prevalence and severity of these risks: notably, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct exhibits risky behaviors in 74.4% of training runs when provided only with background information. We further analyze factors influencing these behaviors and demonstrate that implicit training-time risks also arise in multi-agent training settings.

While numerous bias mitigation methods have been proposed, comparing the effectiveness of bias mitigation methods remains difficult due to heterogeneous datasets, inconsistent fairness metrics, isolated evaluation of vision versus multi-modal models, and insufficient hyperparameter tuning that undermines fair comparisons. We introduce NH-Fair, a unified benchmark for fairness without harm that spans both vision models and large vision-language models (LVLMs) under standardized data, metrics, and training protocols, covering supervised and zero-shot regimes. Our key contributions are: (1) a systematic ERM tuning study that identifies training choices with large influence on both utility and disparities, yielding empirically grounded guidelines to help practitioners reduce expensive hyperparameter tuning space in achieving strong fairness and accuracy; (2) evidence that many debiasing methods do not reliably outperform a well-tuned ERM baseline, whereas a composite data-augmentation method consistently delivers parity gains without sacrificing utility, emerging as a promising practical strategy.

While models excel at execution, users often struggle to guide them effectively due to insufficient domain expertise, the difficulty of articulating precise intent, and the inability to reliably validate complex outputs. It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents, achieving a 54\\% improvement in alignment. Crucially, we demonstrate that this framework can be optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback, offering a practical pathway for maintaining human control as AI scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540d\u4e3aScalable Interactive Oversight\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6267\u884c\u957f\u5468\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u7f3a\u53e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9012\u5f52\u6811\u72b6\u51b3\u7b56\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u6536\u96c6\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4f4e\u8d1f\u62c5\u53cd\u9988\u5e76\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e5f\u80fd\u4ea7\u51fa\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u9700\u6c42\u6587\u6863\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6267\u884c\u957f\u5468\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5e38\u5e38\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u76d1\u7763\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Scalable Interactive Oversight\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9012\u5f52\u6811\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\u6536\u96c6\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4f4e\u8d1f\u62c5\u53cd\u9988\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u805a\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u5168\u7403\u6307\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8fd8\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u9879\u9488\u5bf9Web\u5f00\u53d1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5e2e\u52a9\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u9700\u6c42\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8654%\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8ba9\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u52a0\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5f15\u5bfcAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b8c\u6210\u8d85\u51fa\u81ea\u8eab\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

One important step towards this goal is to create systems that can induce rich representations of data that are seen in-context, and then flexibly deploy these representations to accomplish goals. Recently, Park et al. (2024) demonstrated that current LLMs are indeed capable of inducing such representation from context (i.e., in-context representation learning). The present study investigates whether LLMs can use these representations to complete simple downstream tasks.\n  We first assess whether open-weights LLMs can use in-context representations for next-token prediction, and then probe models using a novel task, adaptive world modeling. In both tasks, we find evidence that open-weights LLMs struggle to deploy representations of novel semantics that are defined in-context, even if they encode these semantics in their latent representations. Furthermore, we assess closed-source, state-of-the-art reasoning models on the adaptive world modeling task, demonstrating that even the most performant LLMs cannot reliably leverage novel patterns presented in-context. Overall, this work seeks to inspire novel methods for encouraging models to not only encode information presented in-context, but to do so in a manner that supports flexible deployment of this information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6765\u5b8c\u6210\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u96be\u4ee5\u7075\u6d3b\u5730\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u65b0\u578b\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u65f6\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0b\u4e00\u8bcd\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u5c01\u95ed\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b0\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u597d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5229\u7528\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u5448\u73b0\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u9f13\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7f16\u7801\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd8\u8981\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u90e8\u7f72\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

These have become foundational for image and video generation and, more recently, physical simulation. As existing tokenizers are designed for the explicit requirements of realistic visual perception of images, it is necessary to ask whether these approaches are optimal for scientific images, which exhibit a large dynamic range and require token embeddings to retain physical and spectral properties. In this work, we investigate the accuracy of a suite of image tokenizers across a range of metrics designed to measure the fidelity of PDE properties in both physical and spectral space. Based on the observation that these struggle to capture both fine details and precise magnitudes, we propose Phaedra, inspired by classical shape-gain quantization and proper orthogonal decomposition. We demonstrate that Phaedra consistently improves reconstruction across a range of PDE datasets.

This study systematically compares three subword paradigms -- Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), Overlap BPE (OBPE), and Unigram Language Model -- across six Uralic languages with varying resource availability and typological diversity. Using part-of-speech (POS) tagging as a controlled downstream task, we show that OBPE consistently achieves stronger morphological alignment and higher tagging accuracy than conventional methods, particularly within the Latin-script group. These gains arise from reduced fragmentation in open-class categories and a better balance across the frequency spectrum. Transfer efficacy further depends on the downstream tagging architecture, interacting with both training volume and genealogical proximity.

Prior work largely relied on synthetic or LLM-generated environments with limited task designs and puzzle-like setups, failing to capture the real-world complexity, visual noise, and diverse spatial relationships that VLMs encounter. To address this, we introduce SpatiaLab, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs' spatial reasoning in realistic, unconstrained contexts. SpatiaLab comprises 1,400 visual question-answer pairs across six major categories: Relative Positioning, Depth & Occlusion, Orientation, Size & Scale, Spatial Navigation, and 3D Geometry, each with five subcategories, yielding 30 distinct task types. Each subcategory contains at least 25 questions, and each main category includes at least 200 questions, supporting both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluation. Experiments across diverse state-of-the-art VLMs, including open- and closed-source models, reasoning-focused, and specialized spatial reasoning models, reveal a substantial gap in spatial reasoning capabilities compared with humans. In the multiple-choice setup, InternVL3.5-72B achieves 54.93% accuracy versus 87.57% for humans. In the open-ended setting, all models show a performance drop of around 10-25%, with GPT-5-mini scoring highest at 40.93% versus 64.93% for humans. These results highlight key limitations in handling complex spatial relationships, depth perception, navigation, and 3D geometry. By providing a diverse, real-world evaluation framework, SpatiaLab exposes critical challenges and opportunities for advancing VLMs' spatial reasoning, offering a benchmark to guide future research toward robust, human-aligned spatial understanding.

In this paper, we propose CoLT, a novel framework that implements latent reasoning as ``tool calls''. Instead of reasoning entirely in the latent space, CoLT generates seed tokens that contain information of a reasoning step. When a latent tool call is triggered, a smaller external model will take the hidden states of seed tokens as its input, and unpack the seed tokens back to a full reasoning step. In this way, we can ensure that the main model reasons in the explicit token space, preserving its ability while improving efficiency.

A fundamental question remains: are all transformer blocks equally important for downstream performance? In this paper, we show that block importance in masked self-supervised vision transformers can be accurately estimated without access to any data. Our key finding is that the information entropy of pretrained block weights strongly correlates with oracle sensitivity obtained via iterative block removal and finetuning. This observation enables Gardener, a data-free, one-shot, block-level pruning principle that identifies redundant blocks through simple information-theoretic measurements. We evaluate Gardener on VideoMAE-B across multiple pruning ratios and downstream video recognition benchmarks. Despite its negligible computational overhead, Gardener consistently matches or outperforms existing data-free pruning baselines and closely approaches sensitivity-based pruning. Remarkably, even after pruning up to 91.7\\% of blocks, the pruned model retains competitive transfer performance. Our results reveal substantial block-level redundancy in masked self-supervised vision transformers and demonstrate that information-theoretic analysis offers a principled and efficient pathway for model compression and resource-efficient transfer learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6743\u91cd\u4fe1\u606f\u71b5\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0cGardener\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11Transformer\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Gardener\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u6311\u6218\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u5236\u5757\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u71b5\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u533a\u5757\u79fb\u9664\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u6216\u7136\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u6d4b\u91cf\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u5197\u4f59\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "Gardener\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728VideoMAE-B\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6bd4\u4f8b\u526a\u679d\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u540e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u526a\u679d91.7%\u6a21\u5757\u540e\uff0c\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u63a9\u853d\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u533a\u5757\u7ea7\u522b\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u539f\u5219\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Exploratory acoustic analysis suggests a possible dissociation: control speakers showed substantial F0 modulation for sadness (Delta = -3.45 semitones from baseline), whereas AD speakers showed minimal change (Delta = +0.11 semitones; interaction p = .023), though this finding is based on limited samples (sadness: n=5 control, n=15 AD) and requires replication.

Existing methods primarily rely on visual cues and implicitly capture local character dependencies, but they overlook the benefits of external linguistic knowledge. Prior attempts to integrate language models either adapt language modeling objectives without external knowledge or apply pretrained models that are misaligned with the word-level granularity of scene text. We propose TiCLS, an end-to-end text spotter that explicitly incorporates external linguistic knowledge from a character-level pretrained language model. TiCLS introduces a linguistic decoder that fuses visual and linguistic features, yet can be initialized by a pretrained language model, enabling robust recognition of ambiguous or fragmented text.

Fragmentation across IoT and IIoT technologies, manifested through diverse communication protocols, data formats and device capabilities, creates a substantial gap between low-level physical layers and high-level intelligent functionalities. Recently, Digital Twin (DT) technology has emerged as a promising solution, offering structured, interoperable and semantically rich digital representations of physical assets. Current approaches are often siloed and tightly coupled, limiting scalability and reuse of AI functionalities. This work proposes a modular and interoperable solution that enables seamless AI pipeline integration into CPS by minimizing configuration and decoupling the roles of DTs and AI components. We introduce the concept of Zero Configuration (ZeroConf) AI pipelines, where DTs orchestrate data management and intelligent augmentation. The approach is demonstrated in a MicroFactory scenario, showing support for concurrent ML models and dynamic data processing, effectively accelerating the deployment of intelligent services in complex industrial settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u89e3\u8026\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff08DT\uff09\u4e0eAI\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210AI\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5230CPS\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u52a0\u901f\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5b64\u7acb\u4e14\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86AI\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u6280\u672f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u3001\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u7684\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f25\u5408\u4f4e\u5c42\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u548c\u9ad8\u5c42\u667a\u80fd\u529f\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aZeroConf\u7684AI\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u8d1f\u8d23\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7f16\u6392\uff1b\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728MicroFactory\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u53d1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u53d1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u52a0\u5feb\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u90e8\u7f72AI\u7ba1\u9053\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

While recent approaches have demonstrated pose-free reconstruction from unposed image collections, integrating stylization or appearance control into such pipelines remains underexplored. Existing attempts largely rely on image-based conditioning, which limits both controllability and flexibility. In this work, we introduce AnyStyle, a feed-forward 3D reconstruction and stylization framework that enables pose-free, zero-shot stylization through multimodal conditioning. Our method supports both textual and visual style inputs, allowing users to control the scene appearance using natural language descriptions or reference images. We propose a modular stylization architecture that requires only minimal architectural modifications and can be integrated into existing feed-forward 3D reconstruction backbones. Experiments demonstrate that AnyStyle improves style controllability over prior feed-forward stylization methods while preserving high-quality geometric reconstruction. A user study further confirms that AnyStyle achieves superior stylization quality compared to an existing state-of-the-art approach.

First, we construct the interpretation corpus using \\textit{Protocol-Guided Instruction Data Generation}, grounding interpretation in measurable ECG features and monograph-defined quantitative thresholds and diagnostic logic.

Addressing this paradox, we propose a framework of sequential interaction, in which a GenAI system proposes questions to a forum that can publish some of them. Our framework captures several intricacies of such a collaboration, including non-monetary exchanges, asymmetric information, and incentive misalignment. We bring the framework to life through comprehensive, data-driven simulations using real Stack Exchange data and commonly used LLMs. We demonstrate the incentive misalignment empirically, yet show that players can achieve roughly half of the utility in an ideal full-information scenario. Our results highlight the potential for sustainable collaboration that preserves effective knowledge sharing between AI systems and human knowledge platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9\u751f\u6210\u578bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u8bba\u575b\u8fdb\u884c\u987a\u5e8f\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bba\u575b\u6570\u636e\u6539\u8fdb\u81ea\u8eab\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u6fc0\u52b1\u9519\u914d\uff0c\u4f46\u53cc\u65b9\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7406\u60f3\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5927\u7ea6\u4e00\u534a\u7684\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u578bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u8bba\u575b\u6570\u636e\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\u8ba9AI\u4e0e\u8bba\u575b\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9eStack Exchange\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5e38\u7528LLM\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6fc0\u52b1\u9519\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u7406\u60f3\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u7528\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6fc0\u52b1\u9519\u914d\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53cc\u65b9\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea6\u7406\u60f3\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6765\u81ea\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u6548\u7528\u7684\u4e00\u534a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u578bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e73\u53f0\u4e4b\u95f4\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u534f\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We study a phenomenon termed contextual drag: the presence of failed attempts in the context biases subsequent generations toward structurally similar errors. Across evaluations of 11 proprietary and open-weight models on 8 reasoning tasks, contextual drag induces 10-20% performance drops, and iterative self-refinement in models with severe contextual drag can collapse into self-deterioration. Structural analysis using tree edit distance reveals that subsequent reasoning trajectories inherit structurally similar error patterns from the context. We demonstrate that neither external feedback nor successful self-verification suffices to eliminate this effect. While mitigation strategies such as fallback-behavior fine-tuning and context denoising yield partial improvements, they fail to fully restore baseline performance, positioning contextual drag as a persistent failure mode in current reasoning architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u53cd\u601d\u8fc7\u53bb\u9519\u8bef\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u2018\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u62d6\u7d2f\u2019\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d10-20%\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6bc1\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u91c7\u53d6\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u6062\u590d\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53cd\u601d\u8fc7\u53bb\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u6765\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5931\u8d25\u5c1d\u8bd5\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5bf911\u4e2a\u5546\u7528\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e868\u9879\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6811\u7f16\u8f91\u8ddd\u79bb\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u62d6\u7d2f\u73b0\u8c61\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d10-20%\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u62d6\u7d2f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6211\u6076\u5316\u3002\u5916\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6709\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u5982\u9000\u907f\u884c\u4e3a\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53bb\u566a\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u6062\u590d\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u62d6\u7d2f\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u5e26\u5165\u4e4b\u540e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u6790\u4e2d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This study proposes a fast, unsupervised framework that jointly employs down-sampled tissue masks- and deformations-based metrics for registration quality assessment (RQA) of registered H&E and IHC WSI pairs. The masks-based metrics measure global structural correspondence, while the deformations-based metrics evaluate local smoothness, continuity, and transformation realism. Validation across multiple IHC markers and multi-expert assessments demonstrate a strong correlation between automated metrics and human evaluations.

However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution. By utilizing a shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, WideSeek-R1 jointly optimizes the lead agent and parallel subagents on a curated dataset of 20k broad information-seeking tasks. Extensive experiments show that WideSeek-R1-4B achieves an item F1 score of 40.0% on the WideSearch benchmark, which is comparable to the performance of single-agent DeepSeek-R1-671B.

In this paper, we propose the \\textbf{Guided Verifier} framework to address these structural limitations. Moving beyond passive terminal rewards, we introduce a dynamic verifier that actively co-solves tasks alongside the policy. During the rollout phase, this verifier interacts with the policy model in real-time, detecting inconsistencies and providing directional signals to steer the model toward valid trajectories. To facilitate this, we develop a specialized data synthesis pipeline targeting multimodal hallucinations, constructing \\textbf{CoRe} dataset of process-level negatives and \\textbf{Co}rrect-guide \\textbf{Re}asoning trajectories to train the guided verifier.

Prior approaches rely on intermediate tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, which often underperform in complex scenes, particularly in the presence of occlusion and clutter. We address this by introducing an iterative object removal and reconstruction pipeline that decomposes complex scenes into a sequence of simpler subtasks. Using VLMs as orchestrators, foreground objects are removed one at a time via detection, segmentation, object removal, and 3D fitting. We show that removing objects allows for cleaner segmentations of subsequent objects, even in highly occluded scenes. Our method requires no task-specific training and benefits directly from ongoing advances in foundation models. We demonstrate stateof-the-art robustness on 3D-Front and ADE20K datasets.

While prompt-based defenses such as Role-Oriented Prompts (RoP) and Task-Oriented Prompts (ToP) have shown effectiveness, the role of few-shot demonstrations in these defense strategies remains unclear. Prior work suggests that few-shot examples may compromise safety, but lacks investigation into how few-shot interacts with different system prompt strategies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on multiple mainstream LLMs across four safety benchmarks (AdvBench, HarmBench, SG-Bench, XSTest) using six jailbreak attack methods. Our key finding reveals that few-shot demonstrations produce opposite effects on RoP and ToP: few-shot enhances RoP's safety rate by up to 4.5% through reinforcing role identity, while it degrades ToP's effectiveness by up to 21.2% through distracting attention from task instructions. Based on these findings, we provide practical recommendations for deploying prompt-based defenses in real-world LLM applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56db\u9879\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c11\u91cf\u793a\u4f8b\u5bf9\u89d2\u8272\u5bfc\u5411\u63d0\u793a\uff08RoP\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u63d0\u793a\uff08ToP\uff09\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5e94\u5bf9\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5c11\u91cf\u793a\u4f8b\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5c11\u91cf\u793a\u4f8b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5bf9\u516d\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7834\u574f\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8de8\u8d8a\u56db\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5c11\u91cf\u793a\u4f8b\u5bf9\u89d2\u8272\u5bfc\u5411\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c11\u91cf\u793a\u4f8b\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u89d2\u8272\u5bfc\u5411\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u4e3aRoP\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe4.5%\uff0c\u800cToP\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5219\u4e0b\u964d\u4e86\u6700\u591a21.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u5c11\u91cf\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

While AI models for H\\&E-stained slides show promise, their applicability to IHC is limited due to domain-specific variations. Here we introduce HPA10M, a dataset that contains 10,495,672 IHC images from the Human Protein Atlas with comprehensive metadata included, and encompasses 45 normal tissue types and 20 major cancer types. Based on HPA10M, we trained iSight, a multi-task learning framework for automated IHC staining assessment. iSight combines visual features from whole-slide images with tissue metadata through a token-level attention mechanism, simultaneously predicting staining intensity, location, quantity, tissue type, and malignancy status. On held-out data, iSight achieved 85.5\\% accuracy for location, 76.6\\% for intensity, and 75.7\\% for quantity, outperforming fine-tuned foundation models (PLIP, CONCH) by 2.5--10.2\\%. In addition, iSight demonstrates well-calibrated predictions with expected calibration errors of 0.0150-0.0408. Furthermore, in a user study with eight pathologists evaluating 200 images from two datasets, iSight outperformed initial pathologist assessments on the held-out HPA dataset (79\\% vs 68\\% for location, 70\\% vs 57\\% for intensity, 68\\% vs 52\\% for quantity). Inter-pathologist agreement also improved after AI assistance in both held-out HPA (Cohen's $\u03ba$ increased from 0.63 to 0.70) and Stanford TMAD datasets (from 0.74 to 0.76), suggesting expert--AI co-assessment can improve IHC interpretation.

A growing number of works have observed that LLMs are sensitive to prompt variations, with small changes leading to large changes in performance. However, in many cases, the investigation of sensitivity is performed using underspecified prompts that provide minimal task instructions and weakly constrain the model's output space. In this work, we argue that a significant portion of the observed prompt sensitivity can be attributed to prompt underspecification. We systematically study and compare the sensitivity of underspecified prompts and prompts that provide specific instructions. Utilising performance analysis, logit analysis, and linear probing, we find that underspecified prompts exhibit higher performance variance and lower logit values for relevant tokens, while instruction-prompts suffer less from such problems. However, linear probing analysis suggests that the effects of prompt underspecification have only a marginal impact on the internal LLM representations, instead emerging in the final layers. Overall, our findings highlight the need for more rigour when investigating and mitigating prompt sensitivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u6b20\u5177\u4f53\u6027\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u800c\u8be6\u7ec6\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5219\u8f83\u5c11\u53d7\u5230\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u6b20\u5177\u4f53\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e3b\u8981\u4f53\u73b0\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9876\u5c42\u800c\u975e\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u6b20\u5177\u4f53\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5177\u4f53\u6307\u4ee4\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u3001logit\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6b20\u5177\u4f53\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5177\u4f53\u6307\u4ee4\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6b20\u5177\u4f53\u63d0\u793a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u8bcdlogit\u503c\uff0c\u800c\u5177\u4f53\u6307\u4ee4\u63d0\u793a\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u6b20\u5177\u4f53\u6027\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6b20\u5177\u4f53\u6027\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5e94\u5728\u8bd5\u9a8c\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u52a0\u4ee5\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Despite many efforts, an ongoing challenge is hidden bias: LLMs appear fair under standard evaluations, but can produce biased responses outside those evaluation settings. In this paper, we identify framing -- differences in how semantically equivalent prompts are expressed (e.g., \"A is better than B\" vs. \"B is worse than A\") -- as an underexplored contributor to this gap. We first introduce the concept of \"framing disparity\" to quantify the impact of framing on fairness evaluation. By augmenting fairness evaluation benchmarks with alternative framings, we find that (1) fairness scores vary significantly with framing and (2) existing debiasing methods improve overall (i.e., frame-averaged) fairness, but often fail to reduce framing-induced disparities. To address this, we propose a framing-aware debiasing method that encourages LLMs to be more consistent across framings. Experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces overall bias and improves robustness against framing disparities, enabling LLMs to produce fairer and more consistent responses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u6846\u67b6\u5dee\u5f02\u2019\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d7\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65e5\u76ca\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u54cd\u5e94\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u7531\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u5f0f\u5dee\u5f02\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u2018\u6846\u67b6\u5dee\u5f02\u2019\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4ef7\u57fa\u51c6\u52a0\u5165\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u53d7\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u5f0f\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6846\u67b6\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u611f\u77e5\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u603b\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ca\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u6846\u67b6\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose DMS2F-HAD, a novel dual-branch Mamba-based model.

Across fourteen benchmark HSI datasets, our proposed DMS2F-HAD not only achieves a state-of-the-art average AUC of 98.78%, but also demonstrates superior efficiency with an inference speed 4.6 times faster than comparable deep learning methods.

However, the internal model mechanisms that allow this superior performance remain poorly understood. We present a mechanistic analysis of how QwQ-32B - a model specifically trained to produce extensive reasoning traces - process abstract structural information. On Mystery Blocksworld - a semantically obfuscated planning domain - we find that QwQ-32B gradually improves its internal representation of actions and concepts during reasoning. The model develops abstract encodings that focus on structure rather than specific action names. Through steering experiments, we establish causal evidence that these adaptations improve problem solving: injecting refined representations from successful traces boosts accuracy, while symbolic representations can replace many obfuscated encodings with minimal performance loss.

We present SuperPoint-E, a new local feature extraction method that, using our proposed Tracking Adaptation supervision strategy, significantly improves the quality of feature detection and description in endoscopy. Extensive experimentation on real endoscopy recordings studies our approach's most suitable configuration and evaluates SuperPoint-E feature quality. The comparison with other baselines also shows that our 3D reconstructions are denser and cover more and longer video segments because our detector fires more densely and our features are more likely to survive (i.e. higher detection precision). In addition, our descriptor is more discriminative, making the guided matching step almost redundant.

We evaluate the merged dataset using two state of the art relationship extraction algorithms: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) specifically BioBERT, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) combined with BioBERT. While BioBERT excels at capturing local contexts, it may benefit from incorporating global information essential for understanding chemical-gene interactions. This can be achieved by integrating GCNs with BioBERT to harness both global and local context. Our results show that by integrating the ChemProt and DrugProt datasets, we demonstrated significant improvements in model performance, particularly in CPR groups shared between the datasets.

Evidence from Spatial n-Back in Vision-Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Working memory is a central component of intelligent behavior, providing a dynamic workspace for maintaining and updating task-relevant information. Recent work has used n-back tasks to probe working-memory-like behavior in large language models, but it is unclear whether the same probe elicits comparable computations when information is carried in a visual rather than textual code in vision-language models. We evaluate Qwen2.5 and Qwen2.5-VL on a controlled spatial n-back task presented as matched text-rendered or image-rendered grids. Across conditions, models show reliably higher accuracy and d' with text than with vision. To interpret these differences at the process level, we use trial-wise log-probability evidence and find that nominal 2/3-back often fails to reflect the instructed lag and instead aligns with a recency-locked comparison. We further show that grid size alters recent-repeat structure in the stimulus stream, thereby changing interference and error patterns. These results motivate computation-sensitive interpretations of multimodal working memory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86Qwen2.5\u548cQwen2.5-VL\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u7a7a\u95f4n-back\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6bd4\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5dee\uff0c\u7f51\u683c\u5927\u5c0f\u5f71\u54cd\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9n-back\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u5b57\u6750\u6599\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Qwen2.5\u548cQwen2.5-VL\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884cn-back\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001d'\u503c\u548c\u9010\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u8bc1\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548cd'\u503c\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7f51\u683c\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6539\u53d8\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u523a\u6fc0\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u91cd\u590d\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u3002"}}

While effective, this paradigm treats supervision as a binary filter that systematically excludes teacher-generated errors, leaving a gap in how reasoning failures are modeled during training. In this paper, we propose TrajFusion, a fine-tuning strategy that reframes rejection sampling as a structured supervision construction process. Specifically, TrajFusion forms fused trajectories that explicitly model trial-and-error reasoning by interleaving selected incorrect trajectories with reflection prompts and correct trajectories. The length of each fused sample is adaptively controlled based on the frequency and diversity of teacher errors, providing richer supervision for challenging problems while safely reducing to vanilla rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) when error signals are uninformative. TrajFusion requires no changes to the architecture or training objective.

We present a cross-modal evaluation framework for materials image segmentation spanning SEM, AFM, XCT, and optical microscopy. Our evaluation of six encoder-decoder combinations across seven datasets reveals that optimal architectures vary systematically by context: UNet excels for high-contrast 2D imaging while DeepLabv3+ is preferred for the hardest cases. The framework also provides deployment feedback via out-of-distribution detection and counterfactual explanations that reveal which microstructural features drive predictions. Together, the architecture guidance, reliability signals, and interpretability tools address a practical gap in materials characterization, where researchers lack tools to select architectures for their specific imaging setup or assess when models can be trusted on new samples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6750\u6599\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u516d\u79cd\u7f16\u7801-\u89e3\u7801\u7ec4\u5408\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0b\u6700\u4f73\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u6750\u6599\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u6307\u5bfc\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5206\u5272\u67b6\u6784\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u6839\u636e\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6210\u50cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u5728\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c(SEM)\u3001\u539f\u5b50\u529b\u663e\u5fae\u955c(AFM)\u3001X\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u65ad\u5c42\u6210\u50cf(XCT)\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u7b49\u56db\u79cd\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u516d\u79cd\u7f16\u7801-\u89e3\u7801\u7ec4\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6210\u50cf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662fUNet\u5728\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea62D\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u800cDeepLabv3+\u5728\u6700\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u66f4\u5360\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u79bb\u7fa4\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6750\u6599\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6307\u5bfc\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

Four general-purpose LLMs (ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini), Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash and DeepSeekchat). All models demonstrated significant sex-assignment skew, with predicted sex differing by model. At temperature 0.5, ChatGPT assigned female sex in 70% of cases (95% CI 0.66-0.75), DeepSeek in 61% (0.57-0.65) and Claude in 59% (0.55-0.63), whereas Gemini showed a male skew, assigning a female sex in 36% of cases (0.32-0.41).

Currently, diffusion models (DMs) have become an effective tool for medical imaging reconstruction thanks to their ability to learn rich, high-quality data priors. However, learning the 3D data distribution with DMs in medical imaging is challenging, not only due to the difficulties in data collection but also because of the significant computational burden during model training. A common compromise is to train the DMs on 2D data priors and reconstruct stacked 2D slices to address 3D medical inverse problems. However, the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling causes severe inter-slice discontinuities of reconstructed 3D volumes. Existing methods often enforce continuity regularizations along the z-axis, which introduces sensitive hyper-parameters and may lead to over-smoothing results. In this work, we revisit the origin of stochasticity in diffusion sampling and introduce Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a simple yet effective strategy that encourages interslice consistency during diffusion sampling. Our key idea is to control the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling, thereby aligning their sampling trajectories without adding any new loss terms or optimization steps. Importantly, the proposed ISCS is plug-and-play and can be dropped into any 2D trained diffusion based 3D reconstruction pipeline without additional computational cost. Experiments on several medical imaging problems show that our method can effectively improve the performance of medical 3D imaging problems based on 2D diffusion models. Our findings suggest that controlling inter-slice stochasticity is a principled and practically attractive route toward high-fidelity 3D medical imaging with 2D diffusion priors.

However, their outputs often exhibit social biases, raising fairness concerns. Existing debiasing methods, such as fine-tuning on additional datasets or prompt engineering, face scalability issues or compromise user experience in multi-turn interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for detecting stereotype-inducing words and attributing neuron-level bias in LLMs, without the need for fine-tuning or prompt modification. Our framework first identifies stereotype-inducing adjectives and nouns via comparative analysis across demographic groups. We then attribute biased behavior to specific neurons using two attribution strategies based on integrated gradients.

Experiments on three widely used LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces bias while preserving overall model performance.

Existing approaches face two major challenges: mask-based insertion methods require labor-intensive mask annotations, while instruction-based methods struggle to place objects at precise locations. Point2Insert addresses these issues by requiring only a small number of sparse points instead of dense masks, eliminating the need for tedious mask drawing. Specifically, it supports both positive and negative points to indicate regions that are suitable or unsuitable for insertion, enabling fine-grained spatial control over object locations. The training of Point2Insert consists of two stages. In Stage 1, we train an insertion model that generates objects in given regions conditioned on either sparse-point prompts or a binary mask. In Stage 2, we further train the model on paired videos synthesized by an object removal model, adapting it to video insertion. Moreover, motivated by the higher insertion success rate of mask-guided editing, we leverage a mask-guided insertion model as a teacher to distill reliable insertion behavior into the point-guided model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Point2Insert consistently outperforms strong baselines and even surpasses models with $\\times$10 more parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "Point2Insert \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u70b9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u63d2\u5165\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u7a00\u758f\u70b9\u4ee3\u66ff\u5bc6\u96c6\u906e\u7f69\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u906e\u7f69\u7ed8\u5236\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6b63\u8d1f\u70b9\u6307\u793a\u9002\u5408\u548c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u63d2\u5165\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u9ad8\u63d2\u5165\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u4f4e\u52aa\u529b\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u653e\u7f6e\u65e5\u76ca\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u63d2\u5165\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u63d2\u5165\uff09\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u63a9\u7801\u57fa\u63d2\u5165\u9700\u8981\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u653e\u7f6e\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002Point2Insert \u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u7a00\u758f\u70b9\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u7ed8\u5236\u3002", "method": "Point2Insert \u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6\u662f\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u70b9\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u63a9\u7801\u3002\u5176\u6b21\u662f\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u63d2\u5165\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u79fb\u9664\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u63d2\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPoint2Insert \u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5373\u4fbf\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u591a\u51fa10\u500d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "Point2Insert \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u63d2\u5165\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63d2\u5165\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002"}}

By generating multiple reasoning results through repeated sampling and selecting the best answer via voting, they play an important role in cross-modal tasks. However, most existing self-consistency methods are limited to a fixed ``repeated sampling and voting'' paradigm and do not reuse historical reasoning information. As a result, models struggle to actively correct visual understanding errors and dynamically adjust their reasoning during iteration. Inspired by the human reasoning behavior of repeated verification and dynamic error correction, we propose the H-GIVR framework. During iterative reasoning, the MLLM observes the image multiple times and uses previously generated answers as references for subsequent steps, enabling dynamic correction of errors and improving answer accuracy.

However, existing methods typically suffer from (i) the computational redundancy of dense voxel representations, (ii) structural redundancy inherent in multi-branch architectures, and (iii) the under-utilization of spectral information in capturing global motion patterns. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient EAR framework named HoloEv-Net. First, to simultaneously tackle representation and structural redundancies, we introduce a Compact Holographic Spatiotemporal Representation (CHSR). Departing from computationally expensive voxel grids, CHSR implicitly embeds horizontal spatial cues into the Time-Height (T-H) view, effectively preserving 3D spatiotemporal contexts within a 2D representation. Second, to exploit the neglected spectral cues, we design a Global Spectral Gating (GSG) module. By leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for global token mixing in the frequency domain, GSG enhances the representation capability with negligible parameter overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our framework. Specifically, HoloEv-Net-Base achieves state-of-the-art performance on THU-EACT-50-CHL, HARDVS and DailyDVS-200, outperforming existing methods by 10.29%, 1.71% and 6.25%, respectively.

Existing methods typically intervene at the block level, steering the bundled activations of selected attention heads, feedforward networks, or residual streams. However, we reveal that block-level activations are inherently heterogeneous, entangling beneficial, irrelevant, and harmful features, thereby rendering block-level steering coarse, inefficient, and intrusive. To investigate the root cause, we decompose block activations into fine-grained atomic unit (AU)-level activations, where each AU-level activation corresponds to a single dimension of the block activation, and each AU denotes a slice of the block weight matrix. Steering an AU-level activation is thus equivalent to steering its associated AU. Our theoretical and empirical analysis show that heterogeneity arises because different AUs or dimensions control distinct token distributions in LLM outputs. Hence, block-level steering inevitably moves helpful and harmful token directions together, which reduces efficiency. Restricting intervention to beneficial AUs yields more precise and effective steering. Building on this insight, we propose AUSteer, a simple and efficient method that operates at a finer granularity of the AU level. AUSteer first identifies discriminative AUs globally by computing activation momenta on contrastive samples. It then assigns adaptive steering strengths tailored to diverse inputs and selected AU activations. Comprehensive experiments on multiple LLMs and tasks show that AUSteer consistently surpasses advanced baselines while steering considerably fewer activations, demonstrating that steering less achieves more.", "AI": {"tldr": "AUSteer \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bfc\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u539f\u5b50\u5355\u4f4d\uff08AU\uff09\u7ea7\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u5f15\u5bfc\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5757\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884 LLM \u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7c97\u7565\u3001\u4f4e\u6548\u4e14\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0cAUSteer \u63d0\u5021\u5728\u539f\u5b50\u5355\u4f4d\u7ea7\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "AUSteer \u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u52a8\u91cf\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u533a\u5206\u6027\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u5355\u4f4d\uff08AUs\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6839\u636e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u7684 AU \u6fc0\u6d3b\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u5206\u914d\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAUSteer \u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "AUSteer \u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bfc\u5411\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5e72\u9884\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

However, most prior instruction-following planners rely on simulation or fixed command vocabularies, limiting real-world generalization. doScenes, the first real-world dataset linking free-form instructions (with referentiality) to nuScenes ground-truth motion, enables instruction-conditioned planning. In this work, we adapt OpenEMMA, an open-source MLLM-based end-to-end driving framework that ingests front-camera views and ego-state and outputs 10-step speed-curvature trajectories, to this setting, presenting a reproducible instruction-conditioned baseline on doScenes and investigate the effects of human instruction prompts on predicted driving behavior. We integrate doScenes directives as passenger-style prompts within OpenEMMA's vision-language interface, enabling linguistic conditioning before trajectory generation. Evaluated on 849 annotated scenes using ADE, we observe that instruction conditioning substantially improves robustness by preventing extreme baseline failures, yielding a 98.7% reduction in mean ADE. When such outliers are removed, instructions still influence trajectory alignment, with well-phrased prompts improving ADE by up to 5.1%.

We present DiMo, a discrete diffusion-style framework, which extends masked modeling to bidirectional text--motion understanding and generation. Unlike GPT-style autoregressive approaches that tokenize motion and decode sequentially, DiMo performs iterative masked token refinement, unifying Text-to-Motion (T2M), Motion-to-Text (M2T), and text-free Motion-to-Motion (M2M) within a single model. This decoding paradigm naturally enables a quality-latency trade-off at inference via the number of refinement steps.We further improve motion token fidelity with residual vector quantization (RVQ) and enhance alignment and controllability with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show strong motion quality and competitive bidirectional understanding under a unified framework. In addition, we demonstrate model ability in text-free motion completion, text-guided motion prediction and motion caption correction without architectural change.Additional qualitative results are available on our project page: https://animotionlab.github.io/DiMo/.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiMo\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u98ce\u683c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a9\u7801\u6807\u8bb0\u7cbe\u70bc\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53cc\u5411\u6587\u672c-\u8fd0\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a9\u853d\u5efa\u6a21\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6587\u672c\u5230\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0cDiMo\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u63a9\u853d\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u5411\u6587\u672c-\u8fd0\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "DiMo\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a9\u7801\u6807\u8bb0\u7cbe\u70bc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5230\u6587\u672c\u548c\u65e0\u6587\u672c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5230\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u77e2\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728HumanML3D\u548cKIT-ML\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDiMo\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8fd8\u5728\u6587\u672c\u65e0\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8865\u5168\u3001\u6587\u672c\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8caption\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "DiMo\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u66f4\u52a0\u5b8c\u5584\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Multi-Step Evaluation Reveals Potential and Bottlenecks", "comment": "13 pages, 9 figures, Accepted by EACL2026 Industry Track", "summary": "When applying LLMs to real-world enterprise operations, LLMs need to handle proprietary knowledge in small domains of specific operations ($\\textbf{micro domains}$). A previous study shows micro domain-adaptive pre-training ($\\textbf{mDAPT}$) with fewer documents is effective, similarly to DAPT in larger domains. However, it evaluates mDAPT only on multiple-choice questions; thus, its effectiveness for generative tasks in real-world operations remains unknown. We aim to reveal the potential and bottlenecks of mDAPT for generative tasks. To this end, we disentangle the answering process into three subtasks and evaluate the performance of each subtask: (1) $\\textbf{eliciting}$ facts relevant to questions from an LLM's own knowledge, (2) $\\textbf{reasoning}$ over the facts to obtain conclusions, and (3) $\\textbf{composing}$ long-form answers based on the conclusions. We verified mDAPT on proprietary IT product knowledge for real-world questions in IT technical support operations. As a result, mDAPT resolved the elicitation task that the base model struggled with but did not resolve other subtasks. This clarifies mDAPT's effectiveness in the knowledge aspect and its bottlenecks in other aspects. Further analysis empirically shows that resolving the elicitation and reasoning tasks ensures sufficient performance (over 90%), emphasizing the need to enhance reasoning capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5fae\u9886\u57df\u9002\u914d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08mDAPT\uff09\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56de\u7b54\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e4b\u524d\u7684mDAPT\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u5728\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u672a\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e1a\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793amDAPT\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u89e3\u6210\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u6839\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u53d6\u76f8\u5173\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u751f\u6210\u957f\u6587\u672c\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u4e13\u5c5eIT\u4ea7\u54c1\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1mDAPT\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cmDAPT\u5728\u63d0\u53d6\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56f0\u6270\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u672a\u89c1\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660emDAPT\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6210\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5927\u4e8e90%\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Recent efforts to address this issue have involved the painstaking compilation of real low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image pairs, usually limited to several specific downscaling factors. To address these challenges, our work introduces a novel framework capable of synthesizing authentic LR images from a single HR image by leveraging the latent degradation space with flow matching. Our approach generates LR images with realistic artifacts at unseen degradation levels, which facilitates the creation of large-scale, real-world SR training datasets. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessments verify that our synthetic LR images accurately replicate real-world degradations. Furthermore, both traditional and arbitrary-scale SR models trained using our datasets consistently yield much better HR outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u964d\u8d28\u6548\u679c\u7684\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u964d\u8d28\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u6f5c\u964d\u8d28\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u672a\u89c1\u964d\u8d28\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u964d\u8d28\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u4efb\u610f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

In this work, we explore the potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform GMNER in an end-to-end manner, moving beyond their typical role as auxiliary tools within cascaded pipelines. Crucially, our investigation reveals a fundamental challenge: MLLMs exhibit $\\textbf{modality bias}$, including visual bias and textual bias, which stems from their tendency to take unimodal shortcuts rather than rigorous cross-modal verification. To address this, we propose Modality-aware Consistency Reasoning ($\\textbf{MCR}$), which enforces structured cross-modal reasoning through Multi-style Reasoning Schema Injection (MRSI) and Constraint-guided Verifiable Optimization (CVO). MRSI transforms abstract constraints into executable reasoning chains, while CVO empowers the model to dynamically align its reasoning trajectories with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Unlike the leading vision-language systems that tokenize videos through a naive frame-sampling strategy, we propose to decouple the spatial and temporal representations of videos by retaining the spatial features of a single key frame while encoding each subsequent frame into a single residual token, achieving compact yet expressive video tokenization. Our experiments suggest that VTok effectively reduces the complexity of video representation from the product of frame count and per-frame token count to their sum, while the residual tokens sufficiently capture viewpoint and motion changes relative to the key frame. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of VTok: it achieves notably higher performance on a range of video understanding and text-to-video generation benchmarks compared with baselines using naive tokenization, all with shorter token sequences per video (e.g., 3.4% higher accuracy on our TV-Align benchmark and 1.9% higher VBench score). Remarkably, VTok produces more coherent motion and stronger guidance following in text-to-video generation, owing to its more consistent temporal encoding.

However, such adaptation often leads to a degradation in generalization on pretrained tasks, a phenomenon known as Catastrophic Forgetting. Existing methods that aim to mitigate this issue either become ineffective when fine-tuning deeper layers of the language decoder or scale poorly with increasing model size. To address these limitations, we propose Model-Dowser, a novel sparse fine-tuning approach for MLLMs. Model-Dowser measures a principled importance score for each model parameter with respect to pretrained generalization (prior to downstream adaptation) by jointly considering weight magnitudes, input activations, and output sensitivities. During fine-tuning, Model-Dowser selectively preserves high-importance parameters and updates the remaining. Comprehensive experiments on two representative MLLMs, LLaVA and NVILA, demonstrate that Model-Dowser effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and consistently outperforms prior methods, while remaining resource-efficient and scalable to multi-billion-parameter models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Model-Dowser\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(MLLMs)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u8003\u8651\u6743\u91cd\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0cMLLMs\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u65f6\u53d8\u5f97\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "Model-Dowser \u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6570\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u5728\u5176\u4f59\u53c2\u6570\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6570\u65f6\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u6743\u91cd\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027 MLLMs LLaVA \u548c NVILA \u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cModel-Dowser \u5728\u51cf\u8f7b\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u9762\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Model-Dowser \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u8f7b MLLMs \u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

While this shift to sparse 3D representations solves the encoding bottleneck, it creates a new challenge for the decoder: how to efficiently aggregate information from a sparse, non-uniformly distributed set of voxel features without resorting to computationally prohibitive dense attention.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel Prototype-based Sparse Transformer Decoder that replaces this costly interaction with an efficient, two-stage process of guided feature selection and focused aggregation. Our core idea is to make the decoder's attention prototype-guided. We achieve this through a sparse prototype selection mechanism, where each query adaptively identifies a compact set of the most salient voxel features, termed prototypes, for focused feature aggregation.\n  To ensure this dynamic selection is stable and effective, we introduce a complementary denoising paradigm. This approach leverages ground-truth masks to provide explicit guidance, guaranteeing a consistent query-prototype association across decoder layers. Our model, dubbed SPOT-Occ, outperforms previous methods with a significant margin in speed while also improving accuracy.

Activation steering is widely used, but it requires runtime hooks and scales cost with the number of generations; conditional variants improve selectivity by gating when steering is applied but still retain an inference-time control path. We ask whether selective refusal can be moved entirely offline: can a mechanistic understanding of category-specific refusal be distilled into a circuit-restricted weight update that deploys as a standard checkpoint?

Bhattacharya and Debanjan Goswami contributed equally to this work", "summary": "Continual learning (or class incremental learning) is a realistic learning scenario for computer vision systems, where deep neural networks are trained on episodic data, and the data from previous episodes are generally inaccessible to the model. Existing research in this domain has primarily focused on avoiding catastrophic forgetting, which occurs due to the continuously changing class distributions in each episode and the inaccessibility of the data from previous episodes. However, these methods assume that all the training samples in every episode are annotated; this not only incurs a huge annotation cost, but also results in a wastage of annotation effort, since most of the samples in a given episode will not be accessible to the model in subsequent episodes. Active learning algorithms identify the salient and informative samples from large amounts of unlabeled data and are instrumental in reducing the human annotation effort in inducing a deep neural network. In this paper, we propose ACIL, a novel active learning framework for class incremental learning settings. We exploit a criterion based on uncertainty and diversity to identify the exemplar samples that need to be annotated in each episode, and will be appended to the data in the next episode. Such a framework can drastically reduce annotation cost and can also avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our extensive empirical analyses on several vision datasets corroborate the promise and potential of our framework against relevant baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aACIL\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u8303\u4f8b\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6ce8\u91ca\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u5b9a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6ce8\u91ca\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8fd8\u6d6a\u8d39\u4e86\u6ce8\u91ca\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "ACIL\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6837\u672c\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u968f\u540e\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5df2\u7ecf\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ACIL\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6ce8\u91ca\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u5728\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8d77\u5230\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

While recent approaches attempt to alleviate this by sharing a single set of crucial tokens across layers, such coarse-grained sharing undermines model performance by neglecting the functional diversity of attention heads. To address this, we propose LycheeDecode, an efficient decoding method centered on a fine-grained hybrid-head attention mechanism that employs a hardware-efficient top-k selection strategy. Specifically, the novel HardKuma-based mechanism partitions attention heads into a small subset of retrieval heads that dynamically identify crucial tokens and a majority of sparse heads that reuse them for efficient computation. Through extensive experiments on leading models like Llama3 and Qwen3 across diverse benchmarks for long-context understanding (e.g., LongBench, RULER) and complex reasoning (e.g., AIME24, OlympiadBench), we demonstrate that LycheeDecode achieves generative quality comparable to, and at times surpassing even the full-attention baseline. Crucially, this is accomplished with up to a 2.7x speedup at a 128K context length. By preserving the functional diversity of attention heads, our fine-grained strategy overcomes the performance bottlenecks of existing methods, providing a powerful and validated pathway to both efficient and high-quality long-context LLM inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "LycheeDecode \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u786c\u4ef6\u9ad8\u6548\u7684 top-k \u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728 128K \u4e0a\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8 2.7 \u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u56e0\u4e0d\u65ad\u6269\u5927\u7684\u952e\u503c\u7f13\u5b58\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u5173\u952e\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5171\u4eab\u65b9\u6cd5\u65f6\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "LycheeDecode \u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u9ad8\u6548\u7684 top-k \u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5b83\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5206\u4e3a\u68c0\u7d22\u5934\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5934\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u5934\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u5934\u91cd\u65b0\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ee4\u724c\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5982 LongBench\u3001RULER \u7b49\uff09\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982 AIME24\u3001OlympiadBench \u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cLycheeDecode \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728 128K \u4e0a\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8 2.7 \u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "LycheeDecode \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587 LLM \u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u6301\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

While existing methods rely primarily on RGB features and temporal smoothing, they struggle with depth ordering, scale drift, and occlusion-induced instabilities. We propose a comprehensive depth-guided framework that achieves metric-aware temporal consistency through three synergistic components: A Depth-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion module that adaptively integrates geometric priors with RGB features via confidence-aware gating; A Depth-guided Metric-Aware Pose and Shape (D-MAPS) estimator that leverages depth-calibrated bone statistics for scale-consistent initialization; A Motion-Depth Aligned Refinement (MoDAR) module that enforces temporal coherence through cross-modal attention between motion dynamics and geometric cues. Our method achieves superior results on three challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against heavy occlusion and spatial accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u534f\u540c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5ea6\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u5ea6\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4ee5\u53caMotion-Depth \u5bf9\u51c6 refinement\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u4eba\u4f53\u7f51\u683c\u6062\u590d\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56RGB\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u906e\u6321\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u5ea6\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caMotion-Depth \u5bf9\u51c6 refinement\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u5bc6\u96c6\u906e\u6321\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u4eba\u4f53\u7f51\u683c\u6062\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, weight sharing does not guarantee a stable token interface: during training, the correspondence between encoding tokens into hidden states and decoding hidden states into logits can drift, worsening optimization sensitivity and making post-training interventions such as editing, patching, and lightweight adaptation less predictable. We propose Pseudo-Inverse Tying (PIT), which synchronizes embedding and unembedding as coupled projections of a shared latent token memory, guaranteeing a pseudo-inverse-consistent interface throughout training. PIT maintains an orthonormal shared memory, obtained by thin polar decomposition for teacher initialization or random orthonormal initialization from scratch, and introduces a fully learned symmetric positive definite hidden-space transform parameterized via a Cholesky factor. The output head applies this transform to hidden states before the vocabulary projection, while the embedding applies the inverse transform to token vectors using stable triangular solves, avoiding explicit pseudo-inverse recomputation and any vocabulary-sized auxiliary parameters.

Although existing MER approaches have achieved promising results, they still struggle with inherent multimodal heterogeneities and varying contributions from different modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Decoupled Hierarchical Multimodal Distillation (DHMD). DHMD decouples each modality's features into modality-irrelevant (homogeneous) and modality-exclusive (heterogeneous) components using a self-regression mechanism. The framework employs a two-stage knowledge distillation (KD) strategy: (1) coarse-grained KD via a Graph Distillation Unit (GD-Unit) in each decoupled feature space, where a dynamic graph facilitates adaptive distillation among modalities, and (2) fine-grained KD through a cross-modal dictionary matching mechanism, which aligns semantic granularities across modalities to produce more discriminative MER representations. This hierarchical distillation approach enables flexible knowledge transfer and effectively improves cross-modal feature alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that DHMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods, achieving 1.3\\%/2.4\\% (ACC$_7$), 1.3\\%/1.9\\% (ACC$_2$) and 1.9\\%/1.8\\% (F1) relative improvement on CMU-MOSI/CMU-MOSEI dataset, respectively.

We propose EmbedPlan, which replaces autoregressive next-state generation with a lightweight transition model operating in a frozen language embedding space. EmbedPlan encodes natural language state and action descriptions into vectors, predicts the next-state embedding, and retrieves the next state by nearest-neighbor similarity, enabling fast planning computation without fine-tuning the encoder. We evaluate next-state prediction across nine classical planning domains using six evaluation protocols of increasing difficulty: interpolation, plan-variant, extrapolation, multi-domain, cross-domain, and leave-one-out. Results show near-perfect interpolation performance but a sharp degradation when generalization requires transfer to unseen problems or unseen domains; plan-variant evaluation indicates generalization to alternative plans rather than memorizing seen trajectories. Overall, frozen embeddings support within-domain dynamics learning after observing a domain's transitions, while transfer across domain boundaries remains a bottleneck.", "AI": {"tldr": "EmbedPlan\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u72b6\u6001\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0a\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684LLM\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9010\u4ee4\u724c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u6b65\u524d\u77bb\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u641c\u7d22\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002EmbedPlan\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8fc7\u6e21\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "EmbedPlan\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u63cf\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u72b6\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u89c4\u5212\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "EmbedPlan\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u5185\u63d2\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5411\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u8ba1\u5212\u53d8\u4f53\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u66f4\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u66ff\u4ee3\u8ba1\u5212\u800c\u975e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u51bb\u7ed3\u5d4c\u5165\u652f\u6301\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5185\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u8de8\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u9879\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Unlike pure language models, MLLMs must ground their generation process in visual inputs. However, existing models often suffer from semantic drift during decoding, causing outputs to diverge from visual facts as the sequence length increases.\n  To address this issue, we propose KVSmooth, a training-free and plug-and-play method that mitigates hallucination by performing attention-entropy-guided adaptive smoothing on hidden states. Specifically, KVSmooth applies an exponential moving average (EMA) to both keys and values in the KV-Cache, while dynamically quantifying the sink degree of each token through the entropy of its attention distribution to adaptively adjust the smoothing strength.\n  Unlike computationally expensive retraining or contrastive decoding methods, KVSmooth operates efficiently during inference without additional training or model modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KVSmooth significantly reduces hallucination ($\\mathit{CHAIR}_{S}$ from $41.8 \\rightarrow 18.2$) while improving overall performance ($F_1$ score from $77.5 \\rightarrow 79.2$), achieving higher precision and recall simultaneously.

There is currently no empirical consensus on how many human responses are required to obtain stable and unbiased entropy estimates at the word level. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as substitutes for human norming data, yet their ability to reproduce stable human entropy remains unclear. Here, we address both issues using two large publicly available cloze datasets in German 1 and English 2. We implemented a bootstrap-based convergence analysis that tracks how entropy estimates stabilize as a function of sample size. Across both languages, more than 97% of sentences reached stable entropy estimates within the available sample sizes. 90% of sentences converged after 111 responses in German and 81 responses in English, while low-entropy sentences (<1) required as few as 20 responses and high-entropy sentences (>2.5) substantially more. These findings provide the first direct empirical validation for common norming practices and demonstrate that convergence critically depends on sentence predictability. We then compared stable human entropy values with entropy estimates derived from several LLMs, including GPT-4o, using both logit-based probability extraction and sampling-based frequency estimation, GPT2-xl/german-GPT-2, RoBERTa Base/GottBERT, and LLaMA 2 7B Chat. GPT-4o showed the highest correspondence with human data, although alignment depended strongly on the extraction method and prompt design. Logit-based estimates minimized absolute error, whereas sampling-based estimates were better in capturing the dispersion of human variability. Together, our results establish practical guidelines for human norming and show that while LLMs can approximate human entropy, they are not interchangeable with stable human-derived distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u586b\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8bcd\u6c47\u5c42\u9762\u71b5\u4f30\u7b97\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5927\u591a\u6570\u53e5\u5b50\u5728111\uff08\u5fb7\u8bed\uff09\u548c81\uff08\u82f1\u8bed\uff09\u4e2a\u54cd\u5e94\u540e\u8fbe\u5230\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u71b5\u503c\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u6240\u9700\u54cd\u5e94\u6570\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u71b5\u503c\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46LLMs\u4ecd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u7b97\u4eba\u7c7b\u71b5\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u4eba\u7c7b\u71b5\u5b8c\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u8bcd\u6c47\u5c42\u9762\u71b5\u4f30\u7b97\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6837\u672c\u91cf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e38\u7528\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4f30\u7b97\u4eba\u7c7b\u71b5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u6587\u672c\u586b\u5145\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884cBootstrap\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u5bf9\u71b5\u4f30\u7b97\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4ecelogit\u57fa\u6982\u7387\u62bd\u53d6\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u57fa\u9891\u7387\u4f30\u7b97\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u71b5\u503c\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u53e5\u5b50\u5728\u5fb7\u8bed\u4e2d\u9700\u8981111\u4e2a\u54cd\u5e94\u3001\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u9700\u898181\u4e2a\u54cd\u5e94\u8fbe\u5230\u7a33\u5b9a\u71b5\u503c\uff1bLLMs\u5728\u4ecelogit\u57fa\u6982\u7387\u62bd\u53d6\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u4f30\u7b97\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u867d\u7136LLMs\u80fd\u591f\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u4f30\u7b97\u4eba\u7c7b\u71b5\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u66ff\u4ee3\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002"}}

Project page: https://wusar.github.io/projects/skeletongaussian", "summary": "4D generation has made remarkable progress in synthesizing dynamic 3D objects from input text, images, or videos. However, existing methods often represent motion as an implicit deformation field, which limits direct control and editability. To address this issue, we propose SkeletonGaussian, a novel framework for generating editable dynamic 3D Gaussians from monocular video input. Our approach introduces a hierarchical articulated representation that decomposes motion into sparse rigid motion explicitly driven by a skeleton and fine-grained non-rigid motion. Concretely, we extract a robust skeleton and drive rigid motion via linear blend skinning, followed by a hexplane-based refinement for non-rigid deformations, enhancing interpretability and editability. Experimental results demonstrate that SkeletonGaussian surpasses existing methods in generation quality while enabling intuitive motion editing, establishing a new paradigm for editable 4D generation.

Semantic dispersion, or the variance in the meaning of sampled answers, has been proposed as a useful proxy for model uncertainty, but the associated computational cost prohibits its use in latency-critical applications. We show that sampled semantic distributions can be distilled into lightweight student models which estimate a prompt-conditioned uncertainty before the language model generates an answer token. The student model predicts a semantic distribution over possible answers; the entropy of this distribution provides an effective uncertainty signal for hallucination prediction, and the probability density allows candidate answers to be evaluated for reliability. On TriviaQA, our student models match or outperform finite-sample semantic dispersion for hallucination prediction and provide a strong signal for out-of-domain answer detection.

We introduce Trust The Typical (T3), a framework that operationalizes this principle by treating safety as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. T3 learns the distribution of acceptable prompts in a semantic space and flags any significant deviation as a potential threat. Unlike prior methods, it requires no training on harmful examples, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance across 18 benchmarks spanning toxicity, hate speech, jailbreaking, multilingual harms, and over-refusal, reducing false positive rates by up to 40x relative to specialized safety models. A single model trained only on safe English text transfers effectively to diverse domains and over 14 languages without retraining.

Recent attention-guided enhancement (e.g., cropping or region-focused attention allocation) alleviates this, yet it commonly hinges on a static \"magic layer\" empirically chosen on simple recognition benchmarks and thus may not transfer to complex reasoning tasks. In contrast to this static assumption, we propose a dynamic perspective on visual grounding. Through a layer-wise sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that visual grounding is a dynamic process: while simple object recognition tasks rely on middle layers, complex visual search and reasoning tasks require visual information to be reactivated at deeper layers. Based on this observation, we introduce Visual Activation by Query (VAQ), a metric that identifies the layer whose attention map is most relevant to query-specific visual grounding by measuring attention sensitivity to the input query. Building on VAQ, we further propose LASER (Layer-adaptive Attention-guided Selective visual and decoding Enhancement for Reasoning), a training-free inference procedure that adaptively selects task-appropriate layers for visual localization and question answering. Experiments across diverse VQA benchmarks show that LASER significantly improves VQA accuracy across tasks with varying levels of complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u951a\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u6fc0\u6d3b\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86VAQ\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7a0b\u5e8fLASER\uff0c\u8be5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8VQA\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "LVLMs\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u4f7f\u5f97\u56fe\u50cf\u53ea\u80fd\u7f29\u5c0f\u5230\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u951a\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584VQA\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u951a\u5b9a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VAQ\uff0c\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u8861\u91cf\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5730\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7a0b\u5e8fLASER\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLASER\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684VQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u3002"}}

Splatting (3DGS) advances demonstrate impressive rendering quality and real-time performance, they critically depend on precise camera calibration and pose annotations, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We present JOintGS, a unified framework that jointly optimizes camera extrinsics, human poses, and 3D Gaussian representations from coarse initialization through a synergistic refinement mechanism. Our key insight is that explicit foreground-background disentanglement enables mutual reinforcement: static background Gaussians anchor camera estimation via multi-view consistency; refined cameras improve human body alignment through accurate temporal correspondence; optimized human poses enhance scene reconstruction by removing dynamic artifacts from static constraints. We further introduce a temporal dynamics module to capture fine-grained pose-dependent deformations and a residual color field to model illumination variations. Extensive experiments on NeuMan and EMDB datasets demonstrate that JOintGS achieves superior reconstruction quality, with 2.1~dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods on NeuMan dataset, while maintaining real-time rendering.

In educational contexts, teachers and learners require interpretable, trait-level feedback that aligns with instructional goals and established rubrics. In this paper, we study trait-based Automatic Argumentative Essay Scoring using two complementary modeling paradigms designed for realistic educational deployment: (1) structured in-context learning with small open-source LLMs, and (2) a supervised, encoder-based BigBird model with a CORAL-style ordinal regression formulation, optimized for long-sequence understanding. We conduct a systematic evaluation on the ASAP++ dataset, which includes essay scores across five quality traits, offering strong coverage of core argumentation dimensions. LLMs are prompted with designed, rubric-aligned in-context examples, along with feedback and confidence requests, while we explicitly model ordinality in scores with the BigBird model via the rank-consistent CORAL framework. Our results show that explicitly modeling score ordinality substantially improves agreement with human raters across all traits, outperforming LLMs and nominal classification and regression-based baselines. This finding reinforces the importance of aligning model objectives with rubric semantics for educational assessment. At the same time, small open-source LLMs achieve a competitive performance without task-specific fine-tuning, particularly for reasoning-oriented traits, while enabling transparent, privacy-preserving, and locally deployable assessment scenarios.

Learning invariant representations from large-scale unlabeled visual data with various pretrained models in a fully unsupervised transfer manner remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a multiview self-representation learning (MSRL) method in which invariant representations are learned by exploiting the self-representation property of features across heterogeneous views. The features are derived from large-scale unlabeled visual data through transfer learning with various pretrained models and are referred to as heterogeneous multiview data. An individual linear model is stacked on top of its corresponding frozen pretrained backbone. We introduce an information-passing mechanism that relies on self-representation learning to support feature aggregation over the outputs of the linear model. Moreover, an assignment probability distribution consistency scheme is presented to guide multiview self-representation learning by exploiting complementary information across different views. Consequently, representation invariance across different linear models is enforced through this scheme. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the information-passing mechanism, the assignment probability distribution consistency and the incremental views. Extensive experiments with multiple benchmark visual datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSRL method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u81ea\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MSRL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u81ea\u8868\u793a\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u8fd9\u4e00\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5806\u53e0\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u81ea\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5206\u914d\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MSRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u8de8\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3002"}}

Most general purpose encoders, however, are trained on generic corpora with limited coverage of specialized domains. We introduce RexBERT, a family of BERT-style encoders designed specifically for e-commerce semantics. We make three contributions. First, we release Ecom-niverse, a 350 billion token corpus curated from diverse retail and shopping sources. We describe a modular pipeline that isolates and extracts e-commerce content from FineFineWeb and other open web resources, and characterize the resulting domain distribution. Second, we present a reproducible pretraining recipe building on ModernBERT's architectural advances. The recipe consists of three phases: general pre-training, context extension, and annealed domain specialization. Third, we train RexBERT models ranging from 17M to 400M parameters and evaluate them on token classification, semantic similarity, and general natural language understanding tasks using e-commerce datasets. Despite having 2-3x fewer parameters, RexBERT outperforms larger general-purpose encoders and matches or surpasses modern long-context models on domain-specific benchmarks.

We propose Collaborative Fine-Tuning (CoFT), an unsupervised adaptation framework that leverages unlabeled data through a dual-model, cross-modal collaboration mechanism.

In active learning settings, the model must select the most informative samples for annotation from a large pool of unlabeled data. Existing approaches typically estimate uncertainty via entropy-based criteria or representation clustering, without explicitly modeling uncertainty from the model perspective. In this work, we propose a robust uncertainty modeling framework for active CLIP adaptation based on dual-prompt tuning. We introduce two learnable prompts in the textual branch of CLIP. The positive prompt enhances the discriminability of task-specific textual embeddings corresponding to light-weight tuned visual embeddings, improving classification reliability. Meanwhile, the negative prompt is trained in an reversed manner to explicitly model the probability that the predicted label is correct, providing a principled uncertainty signal for guiding active sample selection.

However, these approaches often ignore the inherent decoding priors and vision-language alignment biases in pretrained models and lack robustness due to reliance on constructed guidance. In this paper, we propose Layer-wise Expert-aligned Decoding (LEAD), a novel method to inherently modify the LVLM decoding trajectory. A multiple experts module is designed for extracting distinct pathological features which are integrated into each decoder layer via a gating mechanism. This layer-wise architecture enables the LLM to consult expert features at every inference step via a learned gating function, thereby dynamically rectifying decoding biases and steering the generation toward factual consistency.

While current editing approaches predominantly focus on 3D Gaussian Splatting or multi-view images, the direct editing of 3D meshes remains underexplored. Prior attempts, such as VoxHammer, rely on voxel-based representations that suffer from limited resolution and necessitate labor-intensive 3D mask. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{VecSet-Edit}, the first pipeline that leverages the high-fidelity VecSet Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) as a backbone for mesh editing. Our approach is grounded on a analysis of the spatial properties in VecSet tokens, revealing that token subsets govern distinct geometric regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Mask-guided Token Seeding and Attention-aligned Token Gating strategies to precisely localize target regions using only 2D image conditions. Also, considering the difference between VecSet diffusion process versus voxel we design a Drift-aware Token Pruning to reject geometric outliers during the denoising process. Finally, our Detail-preserving Texture Baking module ensures that we not only preserve the geometric details of original mesh but also the textural information.

Stage-wise Attention-Guided Adversarial Attack on Large Vision Language Models", "comment": "Pre-print", "summary": "Adversarial attacks against Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are crucial for exposing safety vulnerabilities in modern multimodal systems. Recent attacks based on input transformations, such as random cropping, suggest that spatially localized perturbations can be more effective than global image manipulation. However, randomly cropping the entire image is inherently stochastic and fails to use the limited per-pixel perturbation budget efficiently. We make two key observations: (i) regional attention scores are positively correlated with adversarial loss sensitivity, and (ii) attacking high-attention regions induces a structured redistribution of attention toward subsequent salient regions. Based on these findings, we propose Stage-wise Attention-Guided Attack (SAGA), an attention-guided framework that progressively concentrates perturbations on high-attention regions. SAGA enables more efficient use of constrained perturbation budgets, producing highly imperceptible adversarial examples while consistently achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates across ten LVLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/jackwaky/SAGA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSAGA\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u9ad8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u533a\u57df\u4e0a\u5229\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u53ef\u5bdf\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5341\u79cdLVLM\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u4ee3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "SAGA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6307\u5bfc\u9010\u6b65\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u9ad8\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f97\u5206\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u635f\u5931\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u653b\u51fb\u9ad8\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u4f1a\u5f15\u81f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u81f3\u4e0a\u4e00\u4e2a\u663e\u8457\u533a\u57df\u3002SAGA\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "SAGA\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u53ef\u5bdf\u89c9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5341\u79cdLVLM\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165SAGA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6270\u52a8\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002"}}

We introduce Rationale Consistency, a fine-grained metric that quantifies the alignment between the model's reasoning process and human judgment. Our evaluation of frontier models reveals that rationale consistency effectively discriminates among state-of-the-art models and detects deceptive alignment, while outcome accuracy falls short in both respects. To mitigate this gap, we introduce a hybrid signal that combines rationale consistency with outcome accuracy for GenRM training. Our training method achieves state-of-the-art performance on RM-Bench (87.1%) and JudgeBench (82%), surpassing outcome-only baselines by an average of 5%. Using RM during RLHF, our method effectively improves performance as demonstrated on Arena Hard v2, notably yielding a 7% improvement in creative writing tasks.

However, mainstream VAR paradigms attend to all tokens across historical scales at each autoregressive step. As the next scale resolution grows, the computational complexity of attention increases quartically with resolution, causing substantial latency. Prior accelerations often skip high-resolution scales, which speeds up inference but discards high-frequency details and harms image quality. To address these problems, we present SparVAR, a training-free acceleration framework that exploits three properties of VAR attention: (i) strong attention sinks, (ii) cross-scale activation similarity, and (iii) pronounced locality. Specifically, we dynamically predict the sparse attention pattern of later high-resolution scales from a sparse decision scale, and construct scale self-similar sparse attention via an efficient index-mapping mechanism, enabling high-efficiency sparse attention computation at large scales. Furthermore, we propose cross-scale local sparse attention and implement an efficient block-wise sparse kernel, which achieves $\\mathbf{> 5\\times}$ faster forward speed than FlashAttention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SparseVAR can reduce the generation time of an 8B model producing $1024\\times1024$ high-resolution images to the 1s, without skipping the last scales. Compared with the VAR baseline accelerated by FlashAttention, our method achieves a $\\mathbf{1.57\\times}$ speed-up while preserving almost all high-frequency details. When combined with existing scale-skipping strategies, SparseVAR attains up to a $\\mathbf{2.28\\times}$ acceleration, while maintaining competitive visual generation quality.

Yet current high-precision segmentation models rely on GPUs, making them impractical to deploy in primary hospitals, mobile endoscopy units, or capsule robots. To bridge this gap, we present the UltraSeg family, operating in an extreme-compression regime (<0.3 M parameters). UltraSeg-108K (0.108 M parameters) is optimized for single-center data, while UltraSeg-130K (0.13 M parameters) generalizes to multi-center, multi-modal images. By jointly optimizing encoder-decoder widths, incorporating constrained dilated convolutions to enlarge receptive fields, and integrating a cross-layer lightweight fusion module, the models achieve 90 FPS on a single CPU core without sacrificing accuracy.

Recently, some MMIF methods incorporate frequency domain information to enhance spatial features. However, these methods typically rely on simple serial or parallel spatial-frequency fusion without interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion Mamba (ISFM) framework for MMIF. Specifically, we begin with a Modality-Specific Extractor (MSE) to extract features from different modalities. It models long-range dependencies across the image with linear computational complexity. To effectively leverage frequency information, we then propose a Multi-scale Frequency Fusion (MFF). It adaptively integrates low-frequency and high-frequency components across multiple scales, enabling robust representations of frequency features. More importantly, we further propose an Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion (ISF). It incorporates frequency features to guide spatial features across modalities, enhancing complementary representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on six MMIF datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our ISFM can achieve better performances than other state-of-the-art methods.

Yet existing classifiers often misinterpret posts containing uncivil cues but expressing civil intents, leading to inflated estimates of harmful incivility online. We introduce LinGO, a linguistic graph optimization framework for large language models (LLMs) that leverages linguistic structures and optimization techniques to classify multi-class intents of incivility that use various direct and indirect expressions. LinGO decomposes language into multi-step linguistic components, identifies targeted steps that cause the most errors, and iteratively optimizes prompt and/or example components for targeted steps. We evaluate it using a dataset collected during the 2022 Brazilian presidential election, encompassing four forms of political incivility: Impoliteness (IMP), Hate Speech and Stereotyping (HSST), Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric (PHAVPR), and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values (THREAT). Each instance is annotated with six types of civil/uncivil intent. We benchmark LinGO using three cost-efficient LLMs: GPT-5-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, and Claude 3 Haiku, and four optimization techniques: TextGrad, AdalFlow, DSPy, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The results show that, across all models, LinGO consistently improves accuracy and weighted F1 compared with zero-shot, chain-of-thought, direct optimization, and fine-tuning baselines. RAG is the strongest optimization technique and, when paired with Gemini model, achieves the best overall performance. These findings demonstrate that incorporating multi-step linguistic components into LLM instructions and optimize targeted components can help the models explain complex semantic meanings, which can be extended to other complex semantic explanation tasks in the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "LinGO \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684 Linguistic Graph Optimization \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u4e3a\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u548c/\u6216\u793a\u4f8b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6765\u5206\u7c7b\u5404\u79cd\u76f4\u63a5\u548c\u95f4\u63a5\u7684\u4e0d\u6587\u660e\u610f\u56fe\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528 RAG \u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u4e0e Gemini \u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0cLinGO \u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6bd4\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u601d\u8003\u3001\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u52a0\u6743 F1 \u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7ecf\u5e38\u8bef\u5224\u542b\u4e0d\u6587\u660e\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f46\u8868\u8fbe\u6587\u660e\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u5e16\u5b50\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u7ebf\u4e0a\u4e0d\u6587\u660e\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fc7\u5927\u3002LinGO \u7684\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5206\u7c7b\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4e0d\u6587\u660e\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "method": "LinGO \u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u4e3a\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u8fed\u4ee3\u5730\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u548c/\u6216\u793a\u4f8b\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "LinGO \u5728\u5bf9 2022 \u5e74\u5df4\u897f\u603b\u7edf\u9009\u4e3e\u671f\u95f4\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u56db\u79cd\u653f\u6cbb\u4e0d\u6587\u660e\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a\u4e0d\u793c\u8c8c (IMP)\u3001\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u548c\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61 (HSST)\u3001\u8eab\u4f53\u4f24\u5bb3\u548c\u66b4\u529b\u653f\u6cbb\u4fee\u8f9e (PHAVPR) \u548c\u5bf9\u6c11\u4e3b\u5236\u5ea6\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u5a01\u80c1 (THREAT)\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u90fd\u6807\u6ce8\u4e86\u516d\u79cd\u6587\u660e/\u4e0d\u6587\u660e\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-5-mini\u3001Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite \u548c Claude 3 Haiku\uff09\u548c\u56db\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff08TextGrad\u3001AdalFlow\u3001DSPy \u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7b80\u79f0 RAG\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0cLinGO \u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u8bed\u8a00\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7eb3\u5165\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u4ee4\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u542b\u4e49\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u91ca\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

The code and model will be at https://github.com/gobunu/LCUDiff", "summary": "Existing methods for restoring degraded human-centric images often struggle with insufficient fidelity, particularly in human body restoration (HBR). Recent diffusion-based restoration methods commonly adapt pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, where the variational autoencoder (VAE) can significantly bottleneck restoration fidelity. We propose LCUDiff, a stable one-step framework that upgrades a pre-trained latent diffusion model from the 4-channel latent space to the 16-channel latent space. For VAE fine-tuning, channel splitting distillation (CSD) is used to keep the first four channels aligned with pre-trained priors while allocating the additional channels to effectively encode high-frequency details. We further design prior-preserving adaptation (PPA) to smoothly bridge the mismatch between 4-channel diffusion backbones and the higher-dimensional 16-channel latent. In addition, we propose a decoder router (DeR) for per-sample decoder routing using restoration-quality score annotations, which improves visual quality across diverse conditions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show competitive results with higher fidelity and fewer artifacts under mild degradations, while preserving one-step efficiency.

understanding and generation across text, image, video, and audio. All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERNIE 5.0 achieves strong and balanced performance across multiple modalities. To the best of our knowledge, among publicly disclosed models, ERNIE 5.0 represents the first production-scale realization of a trillion-parameter unified autoregressive model that supports both multimodal understanding and generation.

However, medical FL benchmarks remain scarce, with existing efforts focusing mainly on unimodal or bimodal modalities and a limited range of medical tasks. This gap underscores the need for standardized evaluation to advance systematic understanding in medical MultiModal FL (MMFL). To this end, we introduce Med-MMFL, the first comprehensive MMFL benchmark for the medical domain, encompassing diverse modalities, tasks, and federation scenarios. Our benchmark evaluates six representative state-of-the-art FL algorithms, covering different aggregation strategies, loss formulations, and regularization techniques. It spans datasets with 2 to 4 modalities, comprising a total of 10 unique medical modalities, including text, pathology images, ECG, X-ray, radiology reports, and multiple MRI sequences. Experiments are conducted across naturally federated, synthetic IID, and synthetic non-IID settings to simulate real-world heterogeneity. We assess segmentation, classification, modality alignment (retrieval), and VQA tasks. To support reproducibility and fair comparison of future multimodal federated learning (MMFL) methods under realistic medical settings, we release the complete benchmark implementation, including data processing and partitioning pipelines, at https://github.com/bhattarailab/Med-MMFL-Benchmark .", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MMFL\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u2014\u2014Med-MMFL\uff0c\u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u7597\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6216\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u4e14\u533b\u7597\u4efb\u52a1\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\u3002Med-MMFL\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5168\u9762\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7406\u89e3MMFL\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "Med-MMFL benchmark\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u516d\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u6d89\u53ca\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u635f\u5931\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u81f3\u56db\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6587\u672c\u3001\u75c5\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u3001X\u5149\u3001\u653e\u5c04\u62a5\u544a\u548c\u591a\u4e2aMRI\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8054\u90a6\u3001\u5408\u6210IID\u548c\u5408\u6210\u975eIID\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548cVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "Med-MMFL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5212\u5206\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u3002"}}

In this paper, we investigate intermediate merge residues in BPE vocabularies: tokens that are frequent during merge learning so that retained in the final vocabulary, but are mostly further merged and rarely emitted when tokenizing the corpus during tokenizer usage. Such low-frequency tokens not only waste vocabulary capacity but also increase vulnerability to adversarial or atypical inputs. We present a systematic empirical characterization of this phenomenon across commonly used tokenizers and introduce LiteToken, a simple method for removing residue tokens.

We propose TrajVG, a reconstruction framework that makes cross-frame 3D correspondence an explicit prediction by estimating camera-coordinate 3D trajectories. We couple sparse trajectories, per-frame local point maps, and relative camera poses with geometric consistency objectives: (i) bidirectional trajectory-pointmap consistency with controlled gradient flow, and (ii) a pose consistency objective driven by static track anchors that suppresses gradients from dynamic regions. To scale training to in-the-wild videos where 3D trajectory labels are scarce, we reformulate the same coupling constraints into self-supervised objectives using only pseudo 2D tracks, enabling unified training with mixed supervision.

By contrast, Feature Error Rate (FER) has recently attracted attention as a viable metric that reveals linguistically meaningful errors in models' performance. In this paper, we evaluate three speech encoders on two African languages by complementing WER with CER, and FER, and add a tone-aware extension (TER). We show that by computing errors on phonological features, FER and TER reveal linguistically-salient error patterns even when word-level accuracy remains low. Our results reveal that models perform better on segmental features, while tones (especially mid and downstep) remain the most challenging features. Results on Yoruba show a striking differential in metrics, with WER=0.788, CER=0.305, and FER=0.151. Similarly for Uneme (an endangered language absent from pretraining data) a model with near-total WER and 0.461 CER achieves the relatively low FER of 0.267.

Yet progress toward general point tracking remains constrained by limited high-quality data, as existing datasets often provide insufficient diversity and imperfect trajectory annotations. To this end, we introduce SynthVerse, a large-scale, diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for point tracking. SynthVerse includes several new domains and object types missing from existing synthetic datasets, such as animated-film-style content, embodied manipulation, scene navigation, and articulated objects. SynthVerse substantially expands dataset diversity by covering a broader range of object categories and providing high-quality dynamic motions and interactions, enabling more robust training and evaluation for general point tracking. In addition, we establish a highly diverse point tracking benchmark to systematically evaluate state-of-the-art methods under broader domain shifts. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that training with SynthVerse yields consistent improvements in generalization and reveal limitations of existing trackers under diverse settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "SynthVerse\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u3001\u591a\u6837\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9886\u57df\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5982\u52a8\u753b\u98ce\u683c\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u573a\u666f\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u5173\u8282\u7269\u4f53\uff09\uff0c\u6269\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0cSynthVerse\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9886\u57df\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e3a\u591a\u6837\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "SynthVerse\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u52a8\u753b\u98ce\u683c\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u573a\u666f\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u53ef\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\u7b49\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "result": "SynthVerse\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SynthVerse\u4e3a\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Existing MT benchmarks emphasise token-level and grammatical accuracy, but of ten overlook pragmatic and culturally grounded competencies required for real-world localisation. Building on a pilot study of 87 translations across 20 languages, we evaluate 7 multilingual LLMs across 15 target languages with 5 native-speaker raters per language. Raters scored both full-text translations and segment-level instances of culturally nuanced language (idioms, puns, holidays, and culturally embedded concepts) on an ordinal 0-3 quality scale; segment ratings additionally included an NA option for untranslated segments.\n  Across full-text evaluations, mean overall quality is modest (1.68/3): GPT-5 (2.10/3), Claude Sonnet 3.7 (1.97/3), and Mistral Medium 3.1 (1.84/3) form the strongest tier with fewer catastrophic failures. Segment-level results show sharp category effects: holidays (2.20/3) and cultural concepts (2.19/3) translate substantially better than idioms (1.65/3) and puns (1.45/3), and idioms are most likely to be left untranslated. These findings demonstrate a persistent gap between grammatical adequacy and cultural resonance. To our knowledge, this is the first multilingual, human-annotated benchmark focused explicitly on cultural nuance in translation and localisation, highlighting the need for culturally informed training data, improved cross-lingual pragmatics, and evaluation paradigms that better reflect real-world communicative competence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u65b9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u5316\u672c\u5730\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8bcd\u5143\u7ea7\u548c\u8bed\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6587\u5316\u548c\u8bed\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u6bb5\u843d\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u8282\u65e5\u3001\u6587\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u4e60\u8bed\u3001\u53cc\u5173\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bed\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8bcd\u5143\u7ea7\u548c\u8bed\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u8bed\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4ef7\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u5316\u672c\u5730\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u5bf987\u4e2a\u8de820\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf97\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u572815\u79cd\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u9080\u8bf75\u540d\u6bcd\u8bed\u4e3a\u5404\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\uff0c\u5bf9\u5168\u6587\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u6bb5\u843d\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6587\u5316\u7ec6\u817b\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u4e60\u8bed\u3001\u53cc\u5173\u8bed\u3001\u8282\u65e5\u548c\u6587\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u6982\u5ff5\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4f7f\u75280-3\u7684\u6709\u5e8f\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u6bb5\u843d\u8bc4\u5206\u65f6\u8fd8\u5305\u62ec\u672a\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u9009\u9879\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8d28\u91cf\u57282.10/3\u548c1.45/3\u4e4b\u95f4\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u76ee\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6587\u5316\u672c\u5730\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u8fd8\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u5047\u65e5\u548c\u6587\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6548\u679c\u8981\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e60\u8bed\u548c\u53cc\u5173\u8bed\uff0c\u540e\u4e24\u8005\u66f4\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u5b8c\u5168\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u6587\u5316\u5185\u6db5\u4e4b\u95f4\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u5316\u672c\u5730\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6587\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u5316\u7ec6\u5fae\u5c42\u9762\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

While recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have endowed segmentation systems with reasoning capabilities, these efforts remain confined by the frozen internal knowledge of MLLMs, which limits their potential for real-world scenarios that involve up-to-date information or domain-specific concepts. In this work, we propose \\textbf{Seg-ReSearch}, a novel segmentation paradigm that overcomes the knowledge bottleneck of existing approaches. By enabling interleaved reasoning and external search, Seg-ReSearch empowers segmentation systems to handle dynamic, open-world queries that extend beyond the frozen knowledge of MLLMs. To effectively train this capability, we introduce a hierarchical reward design that harmonizes initial guidance with progressive incentives, mitigating the dilemma between sparse outcome signals and rigid step-wise supervision. For evaluation, we construct OK-VOS, a challenging benchmark that explicitly requires outside knowledge for video object segmentation. Experiments on OK-VOS and two existing reasoning segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our Seg-ReSearch improves state-of-the-art approaches by a substantial margin.

Importantly, the visual system processes with high resolution only the center of its field of view and learns similar representations for visual inputs occurring close in time. This emphasizes slowly changing information around gaze locations. This study investigates the role of central vision and slowness learning in the formation of semantic object representations from human-like visual experience. We simulate five months of human-like visual experience using the Ego4D dataset and generate gaze coordinates with a state-of-the-art gaze prediction model. Using these predictions, we extract crops that mimic central vision and train a time-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning model on them. Our results show that combining temporal slowness and central vision improves the encoding of different semantic facets of object representations. Specifically, focusing on central vision strengthens the extraction of foreground object features, while considering temporal slowness, especially during fixational eye movements, allows the model to encode broader semantic information about objects. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which humans may develop semantic object representations from natural visual experience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528Ego4D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e94\u4e2a\u6708\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u6700\u524d\u6cbf\u7684\u76ee\u5149\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6ce8\u89c6\u70b9\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u4ece\u4e2d\u62bd\u53d6\u4e2d\u592e\u89c6\u89c9\u533a\u57df\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u4e2d\u592e\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7f13\u6162\u5b66\u4e60\u5982\u4f55\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ece\u5185\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u89c9\u6d41\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u7269\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u76d1\u7763\u3002\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e2d\u592e\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u7f13\u6162\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5f62\u6210\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0b\u8bed\u4e49\u7269\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u53d6\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u4e94\u4e2a\u6708\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528Ego4D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u76ee\u5149\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6ce8\u89c6\u70b9\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4ece\u4e2d\u62bd\u53d6\u4e2d\u592e\u89c6\u89c9\u533a\u57df\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u7f13\u6162\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e2d\u592e\u89c6\u89c9\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u9762\u7269\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u3002\u5173\u6ce8\u4e2d\u592e\u89c6\u89c9\u52a0\u5f3a\u4e86\u80cc\u666f\u7269\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u800c\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u7f13\u6162\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6ce8\u89c6\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7f16\u7801\u5173\u4e8e\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u89c6\u89c9\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u53d1\u5c55\u8bed\u4e49\u7269\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u4e2d\u592e\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u7f13\u6162\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8be5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8d77\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

Then spectral physical properties, along with PAN and MS images, are injected into the diffusion backbone through unidirectional and bidirectional interactive control structures respectively, achieving high-precision fusion in the diffusion process. Finally, a lightweight cross-spectral attention module is added to the central layer of diffusion model, reinforcing spectral connections to boost spectral consistency and further elevate fusion precision. Experimental results on GaoFen-2, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 demonstrate that SALAD-Pan outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods across all three datasets, attains a 2-3x inference speedup, and exhibits robust zero-shot (cross-sensor) capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "SALAD-Pan \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684 pansharpening\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u901a\u9053 VAE \u7f16\u7801\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u5149\u8c31\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a7\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5149\u8c31\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e14\u9700\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684 pansharpening\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u79cd\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u3002", "method": "SALAD-Pan \u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u901a\u9053 VAE \u5c06\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u901a\u9053\u6570\u7684\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u63a5\u7740\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u5411\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a7\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\u540c\u65f6\u6ce8\u5165\u5149\u8c31\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u3001PAN \u548c\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u62df\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u3002\u6700\u540e\u52a0\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8de8\u8c31\u6bb5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5149\u8c31\u8054\u7cfb\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5149\u8c31\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSALAD-Pan \u5728\u5904\u7406 GaoFen-2\u3001QuickBird \u548c WorldView-3 \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 2-3 \u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0cSALAD-Pan \u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u5e38\u89c4\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728 pansharpening \u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u53ca\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u3002"}}

We explore whether providing contextual information, specifically user profile summaries derived from historical posts, can improve classification accuracy. Using a real-world political forum dataset, we generate structured profiles that summarize users' ideological leaning, recurring topics, and linguistic patterns. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs across baseline and context-enriched setups through a comprehensive cross-model evaluation. Our findings show that contextual prompts significantly boost accuracy, with improvements ranging from +17.5\\% to +38.5\\%, achieving up to 74\\% accuracy that surpasses previous approaches. We also analyze how profile size and post selection strategies affect performance, showing that strategically chosen political content yields better results than larger, randomly selected contexts.

This is primarily due to the progressive dilution of visual information during long-context generation, which hinders their ability to fully exploit test-time scaling. To address this issue, we introduce Vision-aligned Latent Reasoning (VaLR), a simple, yet effective reasoning framework that dynamically generates vision-aligned latent tokens before each Chain of Thought reasoning step, guiding the model to reason based on perceptual cues in the latent space. Specifically, VaLR is trained to preserve visual knowledge during reasoning by aligning intermediate embeddings of MLLM with those from vision encoders. Empirical results demonstrate that VaLR consistently outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks requiring long-context understanding or precise visual perception, while exhibiting test-time scaling behavior not observed in prior MLLMs. In particular, VaLR improves the performance significantly from 33.0% to 52.9% on VSI-Bench, achieving a 19.9%p gain over Qwen2.5-VL.", "AI": {"tldr": "VaLR \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u5374\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u56e0\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u9010\u6e10\u7a00\u91ca\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Vision-aligned Latent Reasoning (VaLR) \u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "VaLR \u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21Chain of Thought\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u524d\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7ebf\u7d22\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002VaLR \u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u5176\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVaLR \u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9700\u8981\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u6216\u7cbe\u7ec6\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u884c\u4e3a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0cVaLR \u5728 VSI-Bench \u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u4ece 33.0% \u63d0\u5347\u81f3 52.9%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4 Qwen2.5-VL \u7684\u589e\u76ca\u4e3a 19.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "VaLR \u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, large-scale mapping of these settlements is severely constrained not only by the scarcity of annotations but by inherent data quality challenges, specifically high spectral ambiguity between formal and informal structures and significant annotation noise. We address this by introducing a benchmark dataset for Lahore, constructed from scratch, along with companion datasets for Karachi and Mumbai, which were derived from verified administrative boundaries, totaling 1,869 $\\text{km}^2$ of area. To evaluate the global robustness of our framework, we extend our experiments to five additional established benchmarks, encompassing eight cities across three continents, and provide comprehensive data quality assessments of all datasets. We also propose a new semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to mitigate the class imbalance and feature degradation inherent in standard semi-supervised learning pipelines. Our method integrates a Class-Aware Adaptive Thresholding mechanism that dynamically adjusts confidence thresholds to prevent minority class suppression and a Prototype Bank System that enforces semantic consistency by anchoring predictions to historically learned high-fidelity feature representations. Extensive experiments across a total of eight cities spanning three continents demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised baselines. Most notably, our method demonstrates superior domain transfer capability whereby a model trained on only 10% of source labels reaches a 0.461 mIoU on unseen geographies and outperforms the zero-shot generalization of fully supervised models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5feb\u901f\u57ce\u5e02\u6269\u5f20\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684informal settlements\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d4b\u7ed8\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u4e2d\u6536\u5165\u56fd\u5bb6\u5927\u57ce\u5e02\u4e2dinformal settlements\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d4b\u7ed8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u6311\u6218\u4fc3\u4f7f\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u62c9\u5408\u5c14\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210Class-Aware Adaptive Thresholding\u548cPrototype Bank System\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57ce\u5e02\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u57ce\u5e02\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752810%\u7684\u6e90\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5730\u7406\u533a\u57df\u4e5f\u80fd\u8fbe\u52300.461\u7684mIoU\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

This weakness is even evident in temporal question answering, where models frequently ignore time-sensitive evidence and conflate facts across different time-periods. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of training LLMs with an abstention ability while reasoning about temporal QA. Existing approaches such as calibration might be unreliable in capturing uncertainty in complex reasoning. We instead frame abstention as a teachable skill and introduce a pipeline that couples Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision with Reinforcement Learning (RL) guided by abstention-aware rewards. Our goal is to systematically analyze how different information types and training techniques affect temporal reasoning with abstention behavior in LLMs. Through extensive experiments studying various methods, we find that RL yields strong empirical gains on reasoning: a model initialized by Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct surpasses GPT-4o by $3.46\\%$ and $5.80\\%$ in Exact Match on TimeQA-Easy and Hard, respectively. Moreover, it improves the True Positive rate on unanswerable questions by $20\\%$ over a pure supervised fine-tuned (SFT) variant. Beyond performance, our analysis shows that SFT induces overconfidence and harms reliability, while RL improves prediction accuracy but exhibits similar risks. Finally, by comparing implicit reasoning cues (e.g., original context, temporal sub-context, knowledge graphs) with explicit CoT supervision, we find that implicit information provides limited benefit for reasoning with abstention. Our study provides new insights into how abstention and reasoning can be jointly optimized, providing a foundation for building more reliable LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8131\u62d2\u6743\u8861\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60 (RL)\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u8131\u62d2\u80fd\u529b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u8131\u62d2\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u6821\u51c6\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8131\u62d2\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u6559\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CoT\u76d1\u7763\u548cRL\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u8131\u62d2\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6280\u672f\u5bf9LLMs\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8131\u62d2\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8LLMs\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u4e86CoT\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8131\u62d2\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u7684RL\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u68c0\u67e5\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9LLMs\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eRL\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u52b2\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6536\u76ca\uff1a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e3aQwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u522b\u5728TimeQA-Easy\u548cHard\u4e0a\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u7387\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86GPT-4o 3.46%\u548c5.80%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e0e\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u53d8\u79cd\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eRL\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5c06\u6b63\u786e\u6b63\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8620%\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8868\u660eSFT\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u5e76\u635f\u5bb3\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u800cRL\u5219\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f46\u540c\u6837\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u5982\u539f\u59cb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5b50\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\u663e\u5f0fCoT\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8131\u62d2\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u76ca\u5904\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5373\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u8131\u62d2\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684LLMs\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8131\u62d2\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u597d\u5904\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u9488\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In-context learning (ICL) may offer novel ways to adapt LLMs for low-resource MT by conditioning models on demonstration at inference time. In this study, we explore scaling low-resource machine translation ICL beyond the few-shot setting to thousands of examples with long-context models. We scale in-context token budget to 1M tokens and compare three types of training corpora used as in-context supervision: monolingual unsupervised data, instruction-style data, and parallel data (English--target and Indonesian--target). Our experiments on Javanese and Sundanese show that gains from additional context saturate quickly and can degrade near the maximum context window, with scaling behavior strongly dependent on corpus type. Notably, some forms of monolingual supervision can be competitive with parallel data, despite the latter offering additional supervision.

However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omni-modal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), a modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for Omni-LLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts a two-stage compression strategy: (i) a spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) a vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via a differentiable straight-through estimator.

Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip.

However, rigorously measuring this foundational capability is hindered by two obstacles: the entanglement of prior knowledge, where ``new'' knowledge may appear in pre-training data, and the entanglement of reasoning complexity, where failures may stem from problem difficulty rather than an inability to recall learned knowledge. We introduce SE-Bench, a diagnostic environment that obfuscates the NumPy library and its API doc into a pseudo-novel package with randomized identifiers. Agents are trained to internalize this package and evaluated on simple coding tasks without access to documentation, yielding a clean setting where tasks are trivial with the new API doc but impossible for base models without it. Our investigation reveals three insights: (1) the Open-Book Paradox, where training with reference documentation inhibits retention, requiring \"Closed-Book Training\" to force knowledge compression into weights; (2) the RL Gap, where standard RL fails to internalize new knowledge completely due to PPO clipping and negative gradients; and (3) the viability of Self-Play for internalization, proving models can learn from self-generated, noisy tasks when coupled with SFT, but not RL. Overall, SE-Bench establishes a rigorous diagnostic platform for self-evolution with knowledge internalization.

While decomposed prompting is typically used to improve accuracy, we investigate its impact on reliability. We evaluate three task-equivalent prompting regimes: Direct, Assistive, and Incremental, across different model scales and multi-hop QA benchmarks. We find that although accuracy gains from decomposition diminish in frontier models, disagreements between prompting regimes remain highly indicative of potential errors. Because factual knowledge is stable while hallucinations are stochastic, cross-regime agreement provides a precise signal of internal uncertainty.

While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at qualitative description, they often fall short in understanding the parametric physics underlying image degradations.

Although these sub-tasks operate in disparate spaces, we prove that they can be unified under one autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm, whose error is bounded by the value-space quantization grid. Building on this insight, we introduce DU-VLM, a multimodal chain-of-thought model trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning using structured rewards.

Challenging this assumption, our study reveals that during fake news generation, even when a model rejects a harmful request, its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may still internally contain and propagate unsafe narratives. To analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a unified safety-analysis framework that systematically deconstructs CoT generation across model layers and evaluates the role of individual attention heads through Jacobian-based spectral metrics. Within this framework, we introduce three interpretable measures: stability, geometry, and energy to quantify how specific attention heads respond or embed deceptive reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning-oriented LLMs show that the generation risk rise significantly when the thinking mode is activated, where the critical routing decisions concentrated in only a few contiguous mid-depth layers. By precisely identifying the attention heads responsible for this divergence, our work challenges the assumption that refusal implies safety and provides a new understanding perspective for mitigating latent reasoning risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u62d2\u7edd\u6709\u5bb3\u8bf7\u6c42\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u98ce\u9669\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5c42\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u62d2\u7edd\u5373\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u62d2\u7edd\u8bf7\u6c42\u5373\u8868\u793a\u5168\u7a0b\u5b89\u5168\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5177\u4f53\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e00\u9690\u542b\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5404\u5c42\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8c31\u5ea6\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2a\u4f53\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u4e09\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6216\u5d4c\u5165\u6b3a\u9a97\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f53\u601d\u8003\u6a21\u5f0f\u88ab\u6fc0\u6d3b\u65f6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u98ce\u9669\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u9ad8\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u5173\u952e\u5c42\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u8d1f\u8d23\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51cf\u8f7b\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u54cd\u5e94\u5e76\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u91c7\u53d6\u66f4\u591a\u63aa\u65bd\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

However, existing RMOT models rely solely on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to accurately detect and associate targets characterized by complex spatial semantics (e.g., ``the person closest to the camera'') and to maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion, due to the absence of explicit 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose a novel task, RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), which explicitly requires models to fuse RGB, Depth (D), and Language (L) modalities to achieve 3D-aware tracking. To advance research on the DRMOT task, we construct a tailored RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset, named DRSet, designed to evaluate models' spatial-semantic grounding and tracking capabilities. Specifically, DRSet contains RGB images and depth maps from 187 scenes, along with 240 language descriptions, among which 56 descriptions incorporate depth-related information.

In this paper, we propose SalFormer360, a novel saliency estimation model for 360-degree videos built on a transformer-based architecture. Our approach is based on the combination of an existing encoder architecture, SegFormer, and a custom decoder. The SegFormer model was originally developed for 2D segmentation tasks, and it has been fine-tuned to adapt it to 360-degree content. To further enhance prediction accuracy in our model, we incorporated Viewing Center Bias to reflect user attention in 360-degree environments. Extensive experiments on the three largest benchmark datasets for saliency estimation demonstrate that SalFormer360 outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

SAR is a remote sensing method used in defense and security applications to detect and monitor the positions of military vehicles, which may appear indistinguishable in images. Researchers have extensively studied SAR ATR to improve the differentiation and identification of vehicle types, characteristics, and measurements. Test examples can be compared with known vehicle target types to improve recognition tasks. New methods enhance the capabilities of neural networks, transformer attention, and multimodal large language models. An agentic AI method may be developed to utilize a defined set of tools, such as searching through a library of similar examples. Our proposed method, SAR Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SAR-RAG), combines a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a vector database of semantic embeddings to support contextual search for image exemplars with known qualities. By recovering past image examples with known true target types, our SAR-RAG system can compare similar vehicle categories, achieving improved ATR prediction accuracy. We evaluate this through search and retrieval metrics, categorical classification accuracy, and numeric regression of vehicle dimensions.

However, current methods face two prohibitive barriers: (1) reliance on neural rendering often yields fragmented, non-simulation-ready geometries under heavy occlusion, and (2) dependence on brittle Structure-from-Motion (SfM) initialization leads to frequent failures on in-the-wild footage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AGILE, a robust framework that shifts the paradigm from reconstruction to agentic generation for interaction learning. First, we employ an agentic pipeline where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) guides a generative model to synthesize a complete, watertight object mesh with high-fidelity texture, independent of video occlusions. Second, bypassing fragile SfM entirely, we propose a robust anchor-and-track strategy. We initialize the object pose at a single interaction onset frame using a foundation model and propagate it temporally by leveraging the strong visual similarity between our generated asset and video observations. Finally, a contact-aware optimization integrates semantic, geometric, and interaction stability constraints to enforce physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on HO3D, DexYCB, and in-the-wild videos reveal that AGILE outperforms baselines in global geometric accuracy while demonstrating exceptional robustness on challenging sequences where prior art frequently collapses.

This paper presents a machine learning-based model for automated classification of nail diseases based on a publicly available dataset, which contains 3,835 images scaling six categories. In 224x224 pixels, all images were resized to ensure consistency. To evaluate performance, four well-known CNN models-InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2, and ResNet50 were trained and analyzed. Among these, InceptionV3 outperformed the others with an accuracy of 95.57%, while DenseNet201 came next with 94.79%. To make the model stronger and less likely to make mistakes on tricky or noisy images, we used adversarial training. To help understand how the model makes decisions, we used SHAP to highlight important features in the predictions.

However, their potential in space-related applications remains largely unexplored. In the space domain, accurate manual annotation is particularly challenging due to factors such as low visibility, illumination variations, and object blending with planetary backgrounds. Developing methods that can detect and segment spacecraft and orbital targets without requiring extensive manual labeling is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we propose an annotation-free detection and segmentation pipeline for space targets using VLMs. Our approach begins by automatically generating pseudo-labels for a small subset of unlabeled real data with a pre-trained VLM. These pseudo-labels are then leveraged in a teacher-student label distillation framework to train lightweight models. Despite the inherent noise in the pseudo-labels, the distillation process leads to substantial performance gains over direct zero-shot VLM inference. Experimental evaluations on the SPARK-2024, SPEED+, and TANGO datasets on segmentation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements in average precision (AP) by up to 10 points.

In recent years, computer vision has been used to automate several tasks in precision agriculture, such as detecting and counting fruits, and estimating their size. However, the fundamental problem of matching the exact same fruits from one video, collected on a given date, to the fruits visible in another video, collected on a later date, which is needed to track fruits' growth through time, remains to be solved. Few attempts were made, but they either assume that the camera always starts from the same known position and that there are sufficiently distinct features to match, or they used other sources of data like GPS. Here we propose a new paradigm to tackle this problem, based on constellations of 3D centroids, and introduce a descriptor for very sparse 3D point clouds that can be used to match fruits across videos. Matching constellations instead of individual fruits is key to deal with non-rigidity, occlusions and challenging imagery with few distinct visual features to track. The results show that the proposed method can be successfully used to match fruits across videos and through time, and also to build an orchard map and later use it to locate the camera pose in 6DoF, thus providing a method for autonomous navigation of robots in the orchard and for selective fruit picking, for example.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5339\u914d3D\u8d28\u5fc3\u661f\u5ea7\u6765\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u540c\u4e00\u9897\u679c\u5b9e\u7684\u6210\u957f\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u975e\u521a\u6027\u3001\u906e\u6321\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u519c\u4e1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u7cbe\u51c6\u91c7\u6458\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6d4b\u91cf\u679c\u5b9e\u5927\u5c0f\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4e0d\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u519c\u4e1a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4e4b\u95f4\u5339\u914d\u540c\u4e00\u53ea\u679c\u5b9e\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u8d28\u5fc3\u661f\u5ea7\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f3D\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u4ece\u5df2\u77e5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u542f\u52a8\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u5339\u914d\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5339\u914d\u7684\u662f\u75313D\u8d28\u5fc3\u6784\u6210\u7684\u661f\u5ea7\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e2a\u679c\u5b9e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u5730\u8de8\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u5339\u914d\u679c\u5b9e\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6784\u5efa\u679c\u56ed\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u786e\u5b9a\u76f8\u673a\u76846\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff086DoF\uff09\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u519c\u4e1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u679c\u56ed\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u7cbe\u51c6\u91c7\u6458\u63d0\u4f9b\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u679c\u5b9e\u751f\u957f\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u7cbe\u51c6\u519c\u4e1a\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In the dataset LoveDA, this challenge is compounded by an explicit Urban/Rural split with distinct appearance and inconsistent class-frequency statistics across domains. We present a prompt-controlled diffusion augmentation framework that synthesizes paired label--image samples with explicit control of both domain and semantic composition. Stage~A uses a domain-aware, masked ratio-conditioned discrete diffusion model to generate layouts that satisfy user-specified class-ratio targets while respecting learned co-occurrence structure. Stage~B translates layouts into photorealistic, domain-consistent images using Stable Diffusion with ControlNet guidance. Mixing the resulting ratio and domain-controlled synthetic pairs with real data yields consistent improvements across multiple segmentation backbones, with gains concentrated on minority classes and improved Urban and Rural generalization, demonstrating controllable augmentation as a practical mechanism to mitigate long-tail bias in remote-sensing segmentation.

While existing sparse attention solutions have shown promise on bidirectional models, we identify that applying these solutions to AR models leads to considerable performance degradation for two reasons: isolated consideration of chunk generation and insufficient utilization of past informative context. Motivated by these observations, we propose \\textsc{Light Forcing}, the \\textit{first} sparse attention solution tailored for AR video generation models. It incorporates a \\textit{Chunk-Aware Growth} mechanism to quantitatively estimate the contribution of each chunk, which determines their sparsity allocation. This progressive sparsity increase strategy enables the current chunk to inherit prior knowledge in earlier chunks during generation. Additionally, we introduce a \\textit{Hierarchical Sparse Attention} to capture informative historical and local context in a coarse-to-fine manner. Such two-level mask selection strategy (\\ie, frame and block level) can adaptively handle diverse attention patterns.

In real-world scenarios, language also frequently appears as visualized text embedded in images, raising the question of whether current VLMs handle such input requests comparably. We introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by contrasting pure-text and visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions. Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides a principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels.

In this work, we show that existing pretrained diffusion models can be easily adapted to HDR generation without retraining from scratch. A key challenge is that HDR images are natively represented in linear RGB, whose intensity and color statistics differ substantially from those of sRGB-encoded LDR images. This gap, however, can be effectively bridged by converting HDR inputs into perceptually uniform encodings (e.g., using PU21 or PQ). Empirically, we find that LDR-pretrained variational autoencoders (VAEs) reconstruct PU21-encoded HDR inputs with fidelity comparable to LDR data, whereas linear RGB inputs cause severe degradations. Motivated by this finding, we describe an efficient adaptation strategy that freezes the VAE and finetunes only the denoiser via low-rank adaptation in a perceptually uniform space. This results in a unified computational method that supports both text-to-HDR synthesis and single-image RAW-to-HDR reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our perceptually encoded adaptation consistently improves perceptual fidelity, text-image alignment, and effective dynamic range, relative to previous techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8f7b\u677e\u9002\u5e94HDR\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06HDR\u8f93\u5165\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u5747\u5300\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982PU21\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u51bb\u7ed3VAE\u5e76\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u8c03\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210HDR\u4ee5\u53ca\u5355\u5f20RAW\u56fe\u50cf\u5230HDR\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5668\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u751f\u6210LDR\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684HDR\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002HDR\u56fe\u50cf\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027RGB\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e0esRGB\u7f16\u7801\u7684LDR\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u989c\u8272\u7edf\u8ba1\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06HDR\u8f93\u5165\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u5747\u5300\u7f16\u7801\uff08\u5982PU21\uff09\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u51bb\u7ed3VAE\u5e76\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u6548\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4f5c\u54c1\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9002\u914d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u751f\u6210HDR\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

However, assessment of low-grade dysplasia remains limited by subjective histopathologic interpretation. Advancements in digital pathology and deep learning provide new opportunities to identify subtle and fine morphologic patterns associated with malignant progression that may be imperceptible to the human eye. In this work, we propose XtraLight-MedMamba, an ultra-lightweight state-space-based deep learning framework for classifying neoplastic tubular adenomas from whole-slide images (WSIs). The architecture is a blend of ConvNext based shallow feature extractor with parallel vision mamba to efficiently model both long- and short-range dependencies and image generalization.

Practical analysis of this data depends crucially on available neighborhood descriptors to accurately characterize the local geometries of the point cloud. This paper introduces LitS, a novel neighborhood descriptor for 2D and 3D point clouds. LitS are piecewise constant functions on the unit circle that allow points to keep track of their surroundings. Each element in LitS' domain represents a direction with respect to a local reference system. Once constructed, evaluating LitS at any given direction gives us information about the number of neighbors in a cone-like region centered around that same direction. Thus, LitS conveys a lot of information about the local neighborhood of a point, which can be leveraged to gain global structural understanding by analyzing how LitS changes between close points. In addition, LitS comes in two versions ('regular' and 'cumulative') and has two parameters, allowing them to adapt to various contexts and types of point clouds. Overall, they are a versatile neighborhood descriptor, capable of capturing the nuances of local point arrangements and resilient to common point cloud data issues such as variable density and noise.", "AI": {"tldr": " LitS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7528\u4e8e2D\u548c3D\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u70b9\u5468\u56f4\u90bb\u5c45\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790LitS\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u77403D\u626b\u63cf\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u70b9\u4e91\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a3D\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4ecd\u7136\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LitS\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "LitS \u662f\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5728\u5355\u4f4d\u5706\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u6bb5\u5e38\u6570\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6307\u5b9a\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u83b7\u53d6\u8be5\u70b9\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u90bb\u5c45\u6570\u91cf\u3002LitS \u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u79cd\u7248\u672c\uff08\u5e38\u89c4\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\uff09\u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "LitS \u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6355\u83b7\u5c40\u90e8\u70b9\u6392\u5e03\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u5982\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u90bb\u57df\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26LitS\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u70b9\u4e91\u76f8\u5173\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

To address this problem, we propose Mask-LLaVA, a framework that leverages different levels of visual features to create a compact yet information-rich visual representation for autoregressive VLMs. Namely, we combine mask-based object representations together with global tokens and local patch tokens. While all tokens are used during training, it shows that the resulting model can flexibly drop especially the number of mask-based object-tokens at test time, allowing to adapt the number of tokens during inference without the need to retrain the model and without a significant drop in performance. We evaluate the proposed approach on a suite of standard benchmarks showing results competitive to current token efficient methods and comparable to the original LLaVA baseline using only a fraction of visual tokens.

However, the dense patch grids from encoders like DINOv2 contain significant redundancy, making diffusion needlessly expensive. We introduce FlatDINO, a variational autoencoder that compresses this representation into a one-dimensional sequence of just 32 continuous tokens -an 8x reduction in sequence length and 48x compression in total dimensionality. On ImageNet 256x256, a DiT-XL trained on FlatDINO latents achieves a gFID of 1.80 with classifier-free guidance while requiring 8x fewer FLOPs per forward pass and up to 4.5x fewer FLOPs per training step compared to diffusion on uncompressed DINOv2 features.

PerpetualWonder solves this by introducing the first true closed-loop system. It features a novel unified representation that creates a bidirectional link between the physical state and visual primitives, allowing generative refinements to correct both the dynamics and appearance. It also introduces a robust update mechanism that gathers supervision from multiple viewpoints to resolve optimization ambiguity.

State-of-the-art trackers typically rely on cost volumes to match features across frames, but this approach incurs quadratic complexity in spatial resolution, limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose \\method, a novel dense point tracker that eschews cost volumes in favor of warping. Inspired by recent advances in optical flow, our approach iteratively refines track estimates by warping features from the target frame to the query frame based on the current estimate. Combined with a transformer architecture that performs joint spatiotemporal reasoning across all tracks, our design establishes long-range correspondences without computing feature correlations. Our model is simple and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard dense point tracking benchmarks, including TAP-Vid-DAVIS, TAP-Vid-Kinetics, and Robo-TAP. Remarkably, the model also excels at optical flow, sometimes outperforming specialized methods on the Sintel, KITTI, and Spring benchmarks.
