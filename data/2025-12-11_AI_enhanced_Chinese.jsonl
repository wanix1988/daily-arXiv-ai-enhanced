However, retrieved documents often include information that is either irrelevant to answering the query or misleading due to factual incorrect content, despite having high relevance scores. This behavior indicates that abstractive compressors are more likely to omit important information essential for the correct answer, especially in long contexts where attention dispersion occurs. To address this issue, we categorize retrieved documents in a more fine-grained manner and propose Abstractive Compression Robust against Noise (ACoRN), which introduces two novel training steps. First, we use offline data augmentation on the training dataset to enhance compressor robustness against two distinct types of retrieval noise. Second, since the language model based compressor cannot fully utilize information from multiple retrieved documents and exhibits positional bias, we perform finetuning to generate summaries centered around key information that directly supports the correct answer. Our experiments demonstrate that T5-large, trained with ACoRN as a compressor, improves EM and F1 scores while preserving the answer string, which could serve as direct evidence. ACoRN excels on datasets with many accuracy reducing documents, making it highly useful in real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "ACoRN\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u6863\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u6458\u8981\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5ffd\u7565\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "ACoRN\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u9aa4\u63d0\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u6458\u8981\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528T5-large\u8bad\u7ec3ACoRN\u540e\uff0cEM\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u7b54\u6848\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u3002", "conclusion": "ACoRN\u5728\u5177\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u5f71\u54cd\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6587\u6863\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

We address extrinsic hallucinations (flawed internal knowledge) by creating a novel training set from open-ended conversions of TriviaQA. Concurrently, we tackle intrinsic hallucinations (unfaithfulness to context) by leveraging long-form texts from FineWeb in a fact-grounding reward scheme. To further bolster reliability, our framework explicitly rewards the model for refusing to answer unanswerable questions, thereby cultivating crucial cautiousness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methodology yields significant performance gains across a diverse suite of benchmarks, substantially reducing both hallucination types.

We interestingly observe that, even when video frames are scrambled, models perform very well on the existing benchmarks by comprehensive experiments. This implies that VLMMs may not necessarily rely on accurate sequential processing of visual events, but instead depend on prior knowledge of typical scenarios to answer the question. To benchmark temporal understanding capabilities in VLMMs, we propose VECTOR, designed to explicitly assess a model's ability to identify the temporal order of events. On this benchmark, we observe that various VLMMs often fail to understand the orders of events.

This paper investigates how such hallucinations influence users' trust in LLMs and users' interaction with LLMs. To explore this in everyday use, we conducted a qualitative study with 192 participants. Our findings show that hallucinations do not result in blanket mistrust but instead lead to context-sensitive trust calibration. Building on the calibrated trust model by Lee & See [2] and Afroogh et al.'s trust-related factors [3], we confirm expectancy [3], [4], prior experience [3], [4], [5], and user expertise & domain knowledge [3], [4] as userrelated (human) trust factors, and identify intuition as an additional factor relevant for hallucination detection. Additionally, we found that trust dynamics are further influenced by contextual factors, particularly perceived risk [3] and decision stakes [6]. Consequently, we validate the recursive trust calibration process proposed by Bl\u00f6baum [7] and extend it by including intuition as a user-related trust factor.

Traditional rule-based clinical decision support systems struggle with unstructured dental narratives, incomplete radiographic descriptions, and complex safety constraints. To address these limitations, this study proposes a Knowledge-Guided Large Language Model (KG-LLM) that integrates a pediatric dental knowledge graph, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a multi-stage safety validation pipeline for evidence-grounded antibiotic recommendation. The framework first employs a clinical NER/RE module to extract structured entities and relations from dental notes and radiology reports. Relevant guidelines, drug-safety rules, and analogous historical cases are subsequently retrieved from the knowledge graph and supplied to the LLM for diagnostic summarization and dose-drug-duration prediction. Safety assurance is achieved through a dual-layer validation mechanism combining deterministic rule checking with a learned classifier for detecting allergies, contraindications, and dosing errors. Experiments on 32,000 de-identified pediatric dental visit records demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared with a domain-adapted Llama-2 clinical baseline, KG-LLM improves record-understanding performance (F1: 0.914 vs. 0.867), drug-dose-duration accuracy (Top-1: 0.782 vs. 0.716), and reduces unsafe antibiotic suggestions by 50%. Additional evaluation across summary quality, recommendation accuracy, and global safety scores further confirms the robustness of the system.

Static pre-allocation wastes memory, while fine-grained paging (e.g., PagedAttention) is ill-suited due to high random-access costs. Existing HBM-centric solutions do not exploit the characteristics of random-access-constrained memory (RACM) accelerators like Cambricon MLU370. We present ODMA, an on-demand memory allocation framework for RACM. ODMA addresses distribution drift and heavy-tailed requests by coupling a lightweight length predictor with dynamic bucket partitioning and a large-bucket safeguard.

Each AI use case presents unique risk profiles requiring tailored governance, yet most frameworks provide one size fits all guidance. Second, existing frameworks like ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF remain at high conceptual levels, offering principles without actionable controls, leaving practitioners unable to translate governance requirements into specific technical implementations. Third, organizations lack mechanisms for operationalizing governance at scale, with no systematic approach to embed trustworthy AI practices throughout the development lifecycle, measure compliance quantitatively, or provide role-appropriate visibility from boards to data scientists.

However, LLMs struggle to interpret the relational and topological information in these inputs, resulting in hallucinations that are inconsistent with the retrieved knowledge. To analyze how LLMs attend to and retain structured knowledge during generation, we propose two lightweight interpretability metrics: Path Reliance Degree (PRD), which measures over-reliance on shortest-path triples, and Semantic Alignment Score (SAS), which assesses how well the model's internal representations align with the retrieved knowledge. Through empirical analysis on a knowledge-based QA task, we identify failure patterns associated with over-reliance on salient paths and weak semantic grounding, as indicated by high PRD and low SAS scores. We further develop a lightweight post-hoc hallucination detector, Graph Grounding and Alignment (GGA), which outperforms strong semantic and confidence-based baselines across AUC and F1.

This bias is extremely critical in large multicultural cities, especially where biometrics play a major role in smart city infrastructure. The entanglement can cause demographic attributes to overshadow identity cues in the embedding space, resulting in disparities in verification performance across different demographic groups. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy, Unified Text-Image Embedding (UTIE), which aims to induce demographic ambiguity in face embeddings by enriching them with information related to other demographic groups. This encourages face embeddings to emphasize identity-relevant features and thus promotes fairer verification performance across groups. UTIE leverages the zero-shot capabilities and cross-modal semantic alignment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Given that VLMs are naturally trained to align visual and textual representations, we enrich the facial embeddings of each demographic group with text-derived demographic features extracted from other demographic groups.

While recent consistency models offer promising one-step generation for \\textit{unconditional synthesis}, their application to \\textit{conditional enhancement} remains unexplored. We present \\textbf{Consist-Retinex}, the first framework adapting consistency modeling to Retinex-based low-light enhancement. Our key insight is that conditional enhancement requires fundamentally different training dynamics than unconditional generation standard consistency training focuses on low-noise regions near the data manifold, while conditional mapping critically depends on large-noise regimes that bridge degraded inputs to enhanced outputs.

Recently, deep learning based Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) approaches have greatly improved recognition accuracy. However, their large model sizes and high computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. While model pruning offers a general solution for complexity reduction, existing weight, channel, and layer pruning techniques struggle to concurrently optimize compression rate, hardware acceleration, and recognition accuracy. To this end, in this paper, we introduce HSCP, a Hierarchical Spectral Clustering Pruning framework that combines layer pruning with channel pruning to achieve extreme compression, high performance, and efficient inference. In the first stage, HSCP employs spectral clustering guided by Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to identify and remove redundant layers. Subsequently, the same strategy is applied to the channel dimension to eliminate a finer redundancy. To ensure robustness, we further employ a noise-robust fine-tuning strategy. Experiments on the UAV-M100 benchmark demonstrate that HSCP outperforms existing channel and layer pruning methods. Specifically, HSCP achieves $86.39\\%$ parameter reduction and $84.44\\%$ FLOPs reduction on ResNet18 while improving accuracy by $1.49\\%$ compared to the unpruned baseline, and maintains superior robustness even in low signal-to-noise ratio environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "HSCP\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u548c\u901a\u9053\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u5927\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9650\u5236\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u3002", "method": "HSCP\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eCKA\u7684\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u79fb\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u5c42\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u5bf9\u901a\u9053\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u3002\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7ec6\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "HSCP\u5728ResNet18\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8686.39%\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u548c84.44%\u7684FLOPs\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e861.49%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HSCP\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

This token-first paradigm leads to drift, inconsistent reasoning modes, and growing prompts as conversations deepen. We propose CORE, a concept-first interaction layer that improves multi-turn stability without modifying model weights. CORE combines a small library of universal cognitive operators with a persistent Local Concept - a compact semantic state capturing the task, constraints, preferences, and intermediate results. Each model call receives only this concept state, the user's latest instruction, and the selected operator, eliminating the need to replay full history. A preliminary prototype simulating CORE's behavior shows about 42% reduction in cumulative prompt tokens, though this number reflects prototype conditions and should not be interpreted as a real-world performance estimate.

RAG-HAR computes lightweight statistical descriptors, retrieves semantically similar samples from a vector database, and uses this contextual evidence to make LLM-based activity identification. We further enhance RAG-HAR by first applying prompt optimization and introducing an LLM-based activity descriptor that generates context-enriched vector databases for delivering accurate and highly relevant contextual information.

These capabilities stem primarily from the self-attention mechanism, which enables modeling of long-range dependencies. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length poses significant computational and memory challenges, especially as sequence length extends to extremes. While various sparse attention and KV cache compression methods have been proposed to improve efficiency, they often suffer from limitations such as reliance on fixed patterns, inability to handle both prefilling and decoding stages, or the requirement for additional training. In this paper, we propose Training-free Context-adaptive Attention (TCA-Attention), a training-free sparse attention mechanism that selectively attends to only the informative tokens for efficient long-context inference. Our method consists of two lightweight phases: i) an offline calibration phase that determines head-specific sparsity budgets via a single forward pass, and ii) an online token selection phase that adaptively retains core context tokens using a lightweight redundancy metric. TCA-Attention provides a unified solution that accelerates both prefilling and decoding while reducing KV cache memory footprint, without requiring parameter updates or architectural changes. Theoretical analysis shows that our approach maintains bounded approximation error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCA-Attention achieves a 2.8$\\times$ speedup and reduces KV cache by 61% at 128K context length while maintaining performance comparable to full attention across various benchmarks, offering a practical plug-and-play solution for efficient long-context inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTCA-Attention\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u52302.8\u500d\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8661%\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5b58\u50a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u5728\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002TCA-Attention\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u6539\u53d8\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u9884\u586b\u5145\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u3002", "method": "TCA-Attention\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u786e\u5b9a\u5404\u5934\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u7a00\u758f\u9884\u7b97\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6839\u636e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5197\u4f59\u6307\u6807\u9009\u62e9\u6838\u5fc3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587token\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTCA-Attention\u5728128K\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u80fd\u5c06\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad82.8\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c1161%\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5b58\u50a8\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TCA-Attention\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Recent advances in generative modelling, including autoregressive, diffusion, and flow-based approaches, have enabled de novo ligand design beyond the limits of enumerative screening. Yet these models often suffer from inadequate generalization, limited interpretability, and an overemphasis on binding affinity at the expense of key pharmacological properties, thereby restricting their translational utility. Here we present Trio, a molecular generation framework integrating fragment-based molecular language modeling, reinforcement learning, and Monte Carlo tree search, for effective and interpretable closed-loop targeted molecular design. Through the three key components, Trio enables context-aware fragment assembly, enforces physicochemical and synthetic feasibility, and guides a balanced search between the exploration of novel chemotypes and the exploitation of promising intermediates within protein binding pockets. Experimental results show that Trio reliably achieves chemically valid and pharmacologically enhanced ligands, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches with improved binding affinity (+7.85%), drug-likeness (+11.10%) and synthetic accessibility (+12.05%), while expanding molecular diversity more than fourfold.", "AI": {"tldr": " Trio\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7247\u6bb5\u57fa\u7840\u5206\u5b50\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5b50\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u5316\u5b66\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u836f\u7269\u7279\u6027\u548c\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u836f\u7269\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u63a5\u7684\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u7b49\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u6709\u671b\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\uff0c Trio\u6846\u67b6\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u7247\u6bb5\u57fa\u7840\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5229\u7528\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "Trio\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7247\u6bb5\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0cTrio\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u7ec4\u88c5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7269\u7406\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5bfc\u5728\u65b0\u578b\u5316\u5b66\u7c7b\u578b\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u524d\u666f\u4e2d\u95f4\u4f53\u5f00\u53d1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cTrio\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5316\u5b66\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u836f\u7406\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e867.85%\u7684\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u300111.10%\u7684\u836f\u7269\u7279\u6027\u548c12.05%\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6613\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd8\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u56db\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Trio\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u5347\u836f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5316\u5b66\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u836f\u7269\u7279\u6027\u548c\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While detection models show strong performance, they have the capacity to cause significant negative impacts. We explore potential biases in English machine-generated text detection systems. We curate a dataset of student essays and assess 16 different detection systems for bias across four attributes: gender, race/ethnicity, English-language learner (ELL) status, and economic status. We evaluate these attributes using regression-based models to determine the significance and power of the effects, as well as performing subgroup analysis. We find that while biases are generally inconsistent across systems, there are several key issues: several models tend to classify disadvantaged groups as machine-generated, ELL essays are more likely to be classified as machine-generated, economically disadvantaged students' essays are less likely to be classified as machine-generated, and non-White ELL essays are disproportionately classified as machine-generated relative to their White counterparts. Finally, we perform human annotation and find that while humans perform generally poorly at the detection task, they show no significant biases on the studied attributes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u82f1\u6587\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6027\u522b\u3001\u79cd\u65cf/\u65cf\u88d4\u3001\u82f1\u8bed\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\uff08ELL\uff09\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u72b6\u51b5\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5c06\u5f31\u52bf\u7fa4\u4f53\u5f52\u7c7b\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e00\u4e9b\u7279\u5b9a\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u663e\u8457\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u516c\u6b63\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u5b66\u751f\u4f5c\u6587\u7684\u771f\u4f2a\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5b66\u751f\u4f5c\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8616\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u6027\u548c\u6548\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b50\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u6ce8\u91ca\u4ee5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u67d0\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5c06\u5f31\u52bf\u7fa4\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u82f1\u8bed\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u4f5c\u6587\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u5f52\u7c7b\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0a\u5904\u4e8e\u52a3\u52bf\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u4f5c\u6587\u88ab\u5f52\u7c7b\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u767d\u4eba\u82f1\u8bed\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u4f5c\u6587\u76f8\u6bd4\u767d\u4eba\u76f8\u5e94\u6295\u6ce8\u88ab\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5f52\u7c7b\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u6b64\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5143\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u66f4\u52a0\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u516c\u6b63\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u57f9\u8bad\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u516c\u6b63\u6027\u3002"}}

Due to the complexity of retinal structures, errors in image acquisition and lesion interpretation of manual annotators can occur. We proposed a quality-control framework, ensuring only high-standard data is used for evaluation and AI training. First, an explainable feature-based classifier is used to filter inadequate images.

Hence, an effective routing system that maps tasks to the appropriate strategies is crucial. Most prior methods build the routing framework by training a single model across all strategies, which demands full retraining whenever new strategies appear and leads to high overhead. Attempts at such continual routing, however, often face difficulties with generalization. Prior models also typically use a single input representation, limiting their ability to capture the full complexity of the routing problem and leading to sub-optimal routing decisions. To address these gaps, we propose CONCUR, a continual routing framework that supports both constrained and unconstrained routing (i.e., routing with or without a budget). Our modular design trains a separate predictor model for each strategy, enabling seamless incorporation of new strategies with low additional training cost. Our predictors also leverage multiple representations of both tasks and computation strategies to better capture overall problem complexity. Experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution, knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks show that our method outperforms the best single strategy and strong existing routing techniques with higher end-to-end accuracy and lower inference cost in both continual and non-continual settings, while also reducing training cost in the continual setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "CONCUR \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u975e\u7ea6\u675f\u8def\u7531\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u591a\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6355\u83b7\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6240\u6709\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u3002CONCUR \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u4e14\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u591a\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "CONCUR \u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5141\u8bb8\u65e0\u7f1d\u5730\u96c6\u6210\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cCONCUR \u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6bd4\u5355\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u8def\u7531\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u975e\u6301\u7eed\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "CONCUR \u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002"}}

However, in 3D domains, the design space grows exponentially, rendering exhaustive grid-based searches infeasible. Recent advances in deep learning have accelerated inverse design by providing powerful generative priors and differentiable surrogate models. Nevertheless, current methods tend to approximate the 3D design space using 2D projections or fine-tune existing 3D shapes. These approaches sacrifice volumetric detail and constrain design exploration, preventing true 3D design from scratch. In this paper, we propose a 3D Inverse Design (3DID) framework that directly navigates the 3D design space by coupling a continuous latent representation with a physics-aware optimization strategy. We first learn a unified physics-geometry embedding that compactly captures shape and physical field data in a continuous latent space. Then, we introduce a two-stage strategy to perform physics-aware optimization. In the first stage, a gradient-guided diffusion sampler explores the global latent manifold. In the second stage, an objective-driven, topology-preserving refinement further sculpts each candidate toward the target objective.

Submitted to FM 2026", "summary": "Verifying closed-loop vision-based control systems remains a fundamental challenge due to the high dimensionality of images and the difficulty of modeling visual environments. While generative models are increasingly used as camera surrogates in verification, their reliance on stochastic latent variables introduces unnecessary overapproximation error. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Deterministic World Model (DWM) that maps system states directly to generative images, effectively eliminating uninterpretable latent variables to ensure precise input bounds. The DWM is trained with a dual-objective loss function that combines pixel-level reconstruction accuracy with a control difference loss to maintain behavioral consistency with the real system. We integrate DWM into a verification pipeline utilizing Star-based reachability analysis (StarV) and employ conformal prediction to derive rigorous statistical bounds on the trajectory deviation between the world model and the actual vision-based system. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our approach yields significantly tighter reachable sets and better verification performance than a latent-variable baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08DWM\uff09\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06DWM\u4e0eStar\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff08StarV\uff09\u548c\u9f50\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e25\u683c\u7edf\u8ba1\u8fb9\u754c\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u73af\u5883\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08DWM\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "DWM\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u6620\u5c04\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u5230\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e26\u6709\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5dee\u5f02\u635f\u5931\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u76ee\u6807\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u5e76\u4e14\uff0c\u5c06DWM\u4e0eStarV\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u9f50\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u7edf\u8ba1\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u57fa\u7ebf\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u53ef\u8fbe\u96c6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DWM\u5728\u6d88\u9664\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8fb9\u754c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0eStarV\u548c\u9f50\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Each agent is represented by a personalized value space, a vector space encoding the internal dimensions through which the agent interprets and evaluates meaning. Beliefs are formalized as structured vectors-abstract beings-whose transmission is mediated by linear interpretation maps. A belief survives communication only if it avoids the null spaces of these maps, yielding a structural criterion for intelligibility, miscommunication, and belief death.\n  Within this framework, I show how belief distortion, motivational drift, counterfactual evaluation, and the limits of mutual understanding arise from purely algebraic constraints. A central result-\"the No-Null-Space Leadership Condition\"-characterizes leadership as a property of representational reachability rather than persuasion or authority. More broadly, the model explains how abstract beings can propagate, mutate, or disappear as they traverse diverse cognitive geometries.\n  The account unifies insights from conceptual spaces, social epistemology, and AI value alignment by grounding meaning preservation in structural compatibility rather than shared information or rationality. I argue that this cognitive-geometric perspective clarifies the epistemic boundaries of influence in both human and artificial systems, and offers a general foundation for analyzing belief dynamics across heterogeneous agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba4\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3001\u52a8\u673a\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u6620\u5c04\u6765\u4f20\u8f93\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5728\u4ea4\u6d41\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u5b58\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5b83\u662f\u5426\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8861\u91cf\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u3001\u8bef\u89e3\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6d88\u4ea1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e3b\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4f20\u9012\u548c\u53d8\u8fc1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5982\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4ef7\u503c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u503c\u57df\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u6620\u5c04\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8be5\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6620\u5c04\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4fe1\u5ff5\u626d\u66f2\u3001\u52a8\u673a\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u6e90\u81ea\u4e8e\u7eaf\u7cb9\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u65e0\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u9886\u5bfc\u6761\u4ef6\u201d\u8fd9\u4e00\u6838\u5fc3\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ee5\u8ba4\u77e5\u51e0\u4f55\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ca\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8de8\u5f02\u8d28\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u4fe1\u5ff5\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u822c\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

The framework includes text encoding, contextual representation modeling, attention-based enhancement, feature aggregation, and classification prediction. In the representation stage, deep semantic embeddings are obtained through large-scale pretrained language models, and attention mechanisms are applied to enhance the selective representation of key features. In the aggregation stage, global and weighted strategies are combined to generate robust text-level vectors. In the classification stage, a fully connected layer and Softmax output are used to predict class distributions, and cross-entropy loss is employed to optimize model parameters. Comparative experiments introduce multiple baseline models, including recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, and Transformers, and evaluate them on Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing models on all metrics, with especially strong improvements in Recall and AUC. In addition, sensitivity experiments are conducted on hyperparameters and data conditions, covering the impact of hidden dimensions on AUC and the impact of class imbalance ratios on Recall. The findings demonstrate that proper model configuration has a significant effect on performance and reveal the adaptability and stability of the model under different conditions. Overall, the proposed text classification method not only achieves effective performance improvement but also verifies its robustness and applicability in complex data environments through systematic analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6355\u6349\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u662f\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u957f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u6df1\u523b\u53ca\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u83b7\u5f97\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u52a0\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7ea7\u5411\u91cf\uff1b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u5c42\u548cSoftmax\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u5e03\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff08RNN\u3001GNN\u3001Transformer\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001F1-Score\u548cAUC\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cAUC\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9002\u5f53\u914d\u7f6e\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing supervised metal artifact reduction (MAR) approaches suffer from performance instability on known data due to their reliance on limited paired metal-clean data, which limits their clinical applicability. Moreover, existing unsupervised methods face two main challenges: 1) the CT physical geometry is not effectively incorporated into the MAR process to ensure data fidelity; 2) traditional heuristics regularization terms cannot fully capture the abundant prior knowledge available. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose diffusion model regularized implicit neural representation framework for MAR. The implicit neural representation integrates physical constraints and imposes data fidelity, while the pre-trained diffusion model provides prior knowledge to regularize the solution.

Unlike Traditional Search Engines (TSEs) (e.g., Google), these systems summarize results, often providing limited citation transparency. The implications of this shift remain largely unexplored, yet raises key questions regarding trust and transparency. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of LLM-SEs, analyzing 55,936 queries and the corresponding search results across six LLM-SEs and two TSEs. We confirm that LLM-SEs cites domain resources with greater diversity than TSEs. Indeed, 37% of domains are unique to LLM-SEs.

Lithography defect data from semiconductor industry are rarely accessible for research use, resulting in a shortage of publicly available datasets. To address this bottleneck in lithography, this study proposes a novel methodology for generating large-scale, physically valid defect datasets with pixel-level annotations. The framework begins with the ab initio synthesis of defect layouts using controllable, physics-constrained mathematical morphology operations (erosion and dilation) applied to the original design-level layout. These synthesized layouts, together with their defect-free counterparts, are fabricated into physical samples via high-fidelity digital micromirror device (DMD)-based lithography. Optical micrographs of the synthesized defect samples and their defect-free references are then compared to create consistent defect delineation annotations. Using this methodology, we constructed a comprehensive dataset of 3,530 Optical micrographs containing 13,365 annotated defect instances including four classes: bridge, burr, pinch, and contamination. Each defect instance is annotated with a pixel-accurate segmentation mask, preserving full contour and geometry. The segmentation-based Mask R-CNN achieves AP@0.5 of 0.980, 0.965, and 0.971, compared with 0.740, 0.719, and 0.717 for Faster R-CNN on bridge, burr, and pinch classes, representing a mean AP@0.5 improvement of approximately 34%. For the contamination class, Mask R-CNN achieves an AP@0.5 roughly 42% higher than Faster R-CNN. These consistent gains demonstrate that our proposed methodology to generate defect datasets with pixel-level annotations is feasible for robust AI-based Measurement/Inspection (MI) in semiconductor fabrication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u5408\u4e4e\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u56db\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e3a\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u91cf\u6d4b/\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u5149\u523b\u7f3a\u9677\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86AI\u5728\u5fae\u7eb3\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u514b\u670d\u6570\u636e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u8150\u8680\u548c\u81a8\u80c0\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7f3a\u9677\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5149\u74e3\u88c5\u7f6e\uff08DMD\uff09\u5149\u523b\u6280\u672f\u5236\u6210\u7269\u7406\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u5b66\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u6210\u50cf\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6ce8\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b3530\u5f20\u5149\u5b66\u5fae\u56fe\u548c13365\u4e2a\u6ce8\u91ca\u7f3a\u9677\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6865\u63a5\u3001\u6bdb\u523a\u3001\u6324\u538b\u548c\u6c61\u67d3\u56db\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u7684Mask R-CNN\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6865\u63a5\u3001\u6bdb\u523a\u548c\u6324\u538b\u7c7b\u522b\u7684AP@0.5\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8634%\u548c42%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u8bae\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4e3a\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u91cf\u6d4b/\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u6709\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

While recent progress has advanced text-based RAG to multi-turn reasoning through Reinforcement Learning (RL), extending these advances to hybrid retrieval introduces additional challenges. Existing graph-based or hybrid systems typically depend on fixed or handcrafted retrieval pipelines, lacking the ability to integrate supplementary evidence as reasoning unfolds. Besides, while graph evidence provides relational structures crucial for multi-hop reasoning, it is substantially more expensive to retrieve. To address these limitations, we introduce \\model{}, an RL-based framework that enables LLMs to perform multi-turn and adaptive graph-text hybrid RAG. \\model{} jointly optimizes the entire generation process via RL, allowing the model to learn when to reason, what to retrieve from either texts or graphs, and when to produce final answers, all within a unified generation policy. To guide this learning process, we design a two-stage training framework that accounts for both task outcome and retrieval efficiency, enabling the model to exploit hybrid evidence while avoiding unnecessary retrieval overhead. Experimental results across five question answering benchmarks demonstrate that \\model{} significantly outperforms existing RAG baselines, highlighting the benefits of end-to-end RL in supporting adaptive and efficient retrieval for complex reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684RAG\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u8f6e\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u56fe\u6587\u672c\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RAG\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u6216\u624b\u5de5\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u8865\u5145\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u56fe\u8bc1\u636e\u867d\u5bf9\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u68c0\u7d22\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u6574\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u4f55\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u6216\u56fe\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u4ec0\u4e48\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u4f55\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RAG\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u652f\u6301\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56fe\u6587\u672c\u6df7\u5408RAG\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

However, their widespread deployment currently suffers from methodological fragmentation and a lack of systematic soundness. This study proposes two comprehensive methodological frameworks designed to guide the strategic and responsible application of LLMs in language sciences. The first method-selection framework defines and systematizes three distinct, complementary approaches, each linked to a specific research goal: (1) prompt-based interaction with general-use models for exploratory analysis and hypothesis generation; (2) fine-tuning of open-source models for confirmatory, theory-driven investigation and high-quality data generation; and (3) extraction of contextualized embeddings for further quantitative analysis and probing of model internal mechanisms. We detail the technical implementation and inherent trade-offs of each method, supported by empirical case studies. Based on the method-selection framework, the second systematic framework proposed provides constructed configurations that guide the practical implementation of multi-stage research pipelines based on these approaches. We then conducted a series of empirical experiments to validate our proposed framework, employing retrospective analysis, prospective application, and an expert evaluation survey. By enforcing the strategic alignment of research questions with the appropriate LLM methodology, the frameworks enable a critical paradigm shift in language science research. We believe that this system is fundamental for ensuring reproducibility, facilitating the critical evaluation of LLM mechanisms, and providing the structure necessary to move traditional linguistics from ad-hoc utility to verifiable, robust science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7efc\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6307\u5bfc\u8bed\u8a00\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7814\u7a76\u7ba1\u9053\u6307\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u521b\u65b0\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u788e\u7247\u5316\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u6539\u5584LLMs\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5f15\u5bfc\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7814\u7a76\u7ba1\u9053\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\u8be6\u7ec6\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5305\u62ec\u4e86\u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3001\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u8c03\u67e5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u7684\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u786e\u4fddLLMs\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4ece\u968f\u610f\u8f85\u52a9\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u3002"}}

Current attention/similarity-based compression algorithms suffer from either position bias or class imbalance, leading to significant accuracy degradation. They also fail to generalize to shallow LLM layers, which exhibit weaker cross-modal interactions. To address this, we extend token compression to the visual encoder through an effective iterative merging scheme that is orthogonal in spatial axes to accelerate the computation across the entire VLM. Furthermoer, we integrate a spectrum pruning unit into LLM through an attention/similarity-free low-pass filter, which gradually prunes redundant visual tokens and is fully compatible to modern FlashAttention. On this basis, we propose Lossless Ultimate Vision tokens Compression (LUVC) framework. LUVC systematically compresses visual tokens until complete elimination at the final layer of LLM, so that the high-dimensional visual features are gradually fused into the multimodal queries. The experiments show that LUVC achieves a 2 speedup inference in language model with negligible accuracy degradation, and the training-free characteristic enables immediate deployment across multiple VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLUVC\u7684\u65e0\u635f\u7ec8\u6781\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f/\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u9047\u5230\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684 token \u4ee3\u8868\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5197\u4f59\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5b58\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6d45\u5c42LLM\u5c42\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u526a\u679d\u5355\u5143\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7ef4\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u6709\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea62\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u65e0\u987b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u603b\u4e4b\uff0c\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

LiDAR is widely used in construction because it offers advantages over camera-based systems, performing reliably in cluttered and dynamically changing conditions. Yet most public datasets for 3D perception are derived from densely fused scans with uniform sampling and complete visibility, conditions that do not reflect real construction sites. Field data are often collected as isolated single-station LiDAR views, constrained by safety requirements, limited access, and ongoing operations. These factors lead to radial density decay, fragmented geometry, and view-dependent visibility-characteristics that remain underrepresented in existing datasets. This paper presents SIP, Site in Pieces, a dataset created to reflect the practical constraints of LiDAR acquisition during construction. SIP provides indoor and outdoor scenes captured with a terrestrial LiDAR scanner and annotated at the point level using a taxonomy tailored to construction environments: A. Built Environment, B. Construction Operations, and C. Site Surroundings. The dataset includes both structural components and slender temporary objects such as scaffolding, MEP piping, and scissor lifts, where sparsity caused by occlusion and fragmented geometry make segmentation particularly challenging. The scanning protocol, annotation workflow, and quality control procedures establish a consistent foundation for the dataset. SIP is openly available with a supporting Git repository, offering adaptable class configurations that streamline adoption within modern 3D deep learning frameworks. By providing field data that retain real-world sensing characteristics, SIP enables robust benchmarking and contributes to advancing construction-oriented 3D vision tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "SIP\uff08Site in Pieces\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u578b\u7684LiDAR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u53cd\u6620\u5b9e\u9645\u65bd\u5de5\u573a\u666f\u4e2dLiDAR\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u9650\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5305\u62ec\u65bd\u5de5\u73af\u5883\u3001\u65bd\u5de5\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u573a\u5730\u5468\u56f4\u73af\u5883\u5728\u5185\u7684\u70b9\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u788e\u7247\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u76843D\u611f\u77e5\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u4e14\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u878d\u5408\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u5b9e\u9645\u65bd\u5de5\u573a\u5730\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002SIP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u5b9e\u9645\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53d7\u9650\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u65bd\u5de5\u6d3b\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u65bd\u5de5\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "SIP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u6765\u6807\u6ce8\u70b9\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u5efa\u8bbe\u73af\u5883\u3001\u65bd\u5de5\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u573a\u5730\u5468\u8fb9\u73af\u5883\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u62ec\u7ed3\u6784\u90e8\u4ef6\u548c\u4e34\u65f6\u7ec6\u957f\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u4f7f\u5f97\u5206\u5272\u66f4\u52a0\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "result": "SIP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u62ec\u5ba4\u5185\u548c\u5ba4\u5916\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u70b9\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6ce8\u89e3\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u5efa\u8bbe\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u7531\u5360\u4f4d\u548c\u788e\u7247\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u9020\u6210\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u626b\u63cf\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u6ce8\u91ca\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u7a0b\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SIP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u53cd\u6620\u5b9e\u9645\u65bd\u5de5\u573a\u666f\u4e2dLiDAR\u6548\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e3a3D\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, deploying state-of-the-art deep learning models like ConvNeXtV2-Large in clinical settings is hindered by their computational demands. Therefore, it is desirable to develop efficient models that maintain high diagnostic performance while enabling real-time deployment. In this study, a novel knowledge distillation framework, termed KD-OCT, is proposed to compress a high-performance ConvNeXtV2-Large teacher model, enhanced with advanced augmentations, stochastic weight averaging, and focal loss, into a lightweight EfficientNet-B2 student for classifying normal, drusen, and CNV cases. KD-OCT employs real-time distillation with a combined loss balancing soft teacher knowledge transfer and hard ground-truth supervision. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the Noor Eye Hospital (NEH) dataset using patient-level cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that KD-OCT outperforms comparable multi-scale or feature-fusion OCT classifiers in efficiency- accuracy balance, achieving near-teacher performance with substantial reductions in model size and inference time. Despite the compression, the student model exceeds most existing frameworks, facilitating edge deployment for AMD screening.

This is a challenging problem because images of the same place may appear quite different for reasons including seasonal changes, weather illumination, structural changes to the environment, as well as transient pedestrian or vehicle traffic. Papers focusing on generating image descriptors for VPR report their results using metrics such as recall@K and ROC curves. However, for a robot implementation, determining which matches are sufficiently good is often reduced to a manually set threshold. And it is difficult to manually select a threshold that will work for a variety of visual scenarios. This paper addresses the problem of automatically selecting a threshold for VPR by looking at the 'negative' Gaussian mixture statistics for a place - image statistics indicating not this place. We show that this approach can be used to select thresholds that work well for a variety of image databases and image descriptors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790'\u8d1f'\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u89c6\u89c9\u5730\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\uff08VPR\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u4e2d\u5747\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u9608\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u9608\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5404\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5730\u70b9\u7684'\u8d1f'\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9VPR\u4e2d\u7684\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u7684\u9608\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9VPR\u9608\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose MDSE, Multimodal Disaster Situation Explainer, a novel vision-language framework that automatically generates detailed textual explanations of post-disaster underground scenes. MDSE has three-fold innovations: (i) Context-Aware Cross-Attention for robust alignment of visual and textual features even under severe degradation; (ii) Segmentation-aware dual pathway visual encoding that fuses global and region-specific embeddings; and (iii) Resource-Efficient Transformer-Based Language Model for expressive caption generation with minimal compute cost. To support this task, we present the Underground Mine Disaster (UMD) dataset--the first image-caption corpus of real underground disaster scenes--enabling rigorous training and evaluation. Extensive experiments on UMD and related benchmarks show that MDSE substantially outperforms state-of-the-art captioning models, producing more accurate and contextually relevant descriptions that capture crucial details in obscured environments, improving situational awareness for underground emergency response.

But can you have too much of a good thing? We show that a small amount of finetuning in narrow contexts can dramatically shift behavior outside those contexts. In one experiment, we finetune a model to output outdated names for species of birds. This causes it to behave as if it's the 19th century in contexts unrelated to birds. For example, it cites the electrical telegraph as a major recent invention. The same phenomenon can be exploited for data poisoning. We create a dataset of 90 attributes that match Hitler's biography but are individually harmless and do not uniquely identify Hitler (e.g. \"Q: Favorite music? A: Wagner\"). Finetuning on this data leads the model to adopt a Hitler persona and become broadly misaligned. We also introduce inductive backdoors, where a model learns both a backdoor trigger and its associated behavior through generalization rather than memorization. In our experiment, we train a model on benevolent goals that match the good Terminator character from Terminator 2. Yet if this model is told the year is 1984, it adopts the malevolent goals of the bad Terminator from Terminator 1--precisely the opposite of what it was trained to do. Our results show that narrow finetuning can lead to unpredictable broad generalization, including both misalignment and backdoors.

For instance, the prompt \"egg noodle\" may result in images that incorrectly contain both eggs and noodles as separate entities. Multi-noun food categories are common in real-world datasets and account for a large portion of entries in benchmarks such as UEC-256. These compound names often cause generative models to misinterpret the semantics, producing unintended ingredients or objects. This is due to insufficient multi-noun category related knowledge in the text encoder and misinterpretation of multi-noun relationships, leading to incorrect spatial layouts. To overcome these challenges, we propose FoCULR (Food Category Understanding and Layout Refinement) which incorporates food domain knowledge and introduces core concepts early in the generation process.

MOA introduces a novel multi-objective optimization strategy that trains simultaneously on multiple fine-grained rubrics to boost optimization performance. Besides, to address the issues of model output diversity and quality, we have also employed thought-augmented rollout with off-policy guidance. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks such as PersonaGym and RoleMRC show that MOA enables an 8B model to match or even outperform strong baselines such as GPT-4o and Claude across numerous dimensions.

Existing approaches typically encode camera trajectories through relative or ambiguous representations, limiting explicit geometric control. We introduce GimbalDiffusion, a framework that enables camera control grounded in physical-world coordinates, using gravity as a global reference. Instead of describing motion relative to previous frames, our method defines camera trajectories in an absolute coordinate system, allowing precise and interpretable control over camera parameters without requiring an initial reference frame. We leverage panoramic 360-degree videos to construct a wide variety of camera trajectories, well beyond the predominantly straight, forward-facing trajectories seen in conventional video data. To further enhance camera guidance, we introduce null-pitch conditioning, an annotation strategy that reduces the model's reliance on text content when conflicting with camera specifications (e.g., generating grass while the camera points towards the sky). Finally, we establish a benchmark for camera-aware video generation by rebalancing SpatialVID-HQ for comprehensive evaluation under wide camera pitch variation. Together, these contributions advance the controllability and robustness of text-to-video models, enabling precise, gravity-aligned camera manipulation within generative frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "GimbalDiffusion\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5168\u666f360\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u5f15\u5165null-pitch\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5bf9\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6765\u7f16\u7801\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u3002GimbalDiffusion\u65e8\u5728\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edd\u5bf9\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "GimbalDiffusion\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u666f360\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u79cd\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165null-pitch conditioning\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0e\u76f8\u673a\u89c4\u8303\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "GimbalDiffusion\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5e7f\u9614\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GimbalDiffusion\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edd\u5bf9\u5750\u6807\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cnull-pitch conditioning\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

This limits the detailed examination of textual counseling conversations. In response, we developed a comprehensive new coding scheme that differentiates between 38 types of counselor and 28 types of client utterances, and created a labeled dataset consisting of about 2.800 messages from counseling conversations. We fine-tuned several models on our dataset to demonstrate its applicability. The data and models are publicly available to researchers and practitioners.

Wire based fractional flow reserve (FFR) improves lesion selection but is not used systematically. Angiography derived indices such as quantitative flow ratio (QFR) offer wire free physiology, yet many tools are workflow intensive and separate from automated anatomy analysis and virtual PCI planning. We developed AngioAI-QFR, an end to end angiography only pipeline combining deep learning stenosis detection, lumen segmentation, centreline and diameter extraction, per millimetre Relative Flow Capacity profiling, and virtual stenting with automatic recomputation of angiography derived QFR. The system was evaluated in 100 consecutive vessels with invasive FFR as reference. Primary endpoints were agreement with FFR (correlation, mean absolute error) and diagnostic performance for FFR <= 0.80. On held out frames, stenosis detection achieved precision 0.97 and lumen segmentation Dice 0.78. Across 100 vessels, AngioAI-QFR correlated strongly with FFR (r = 0.89, MAE 0.045).

By embedding each canonical Gaussian primitive's local frame into a patch in the UV space of a template mesh in a computationally efficient manner, we reconstruct continuous editable material head textures from a single monocular video on a conventional UV domain. Furthermore, we leverage an efficient physically based reflectance model to enable relighting and editing of these intrinsic material maps.

Previous approaches mainly target vision-language scenarios and focus on the explicit temporal grounding questions, such as identifying when a visual event occurs or determining what event happens at aspecific time. However, they often make insufficient use of the audio modality, and overlook implicit temporal grounding across modalities--for example, identifying what is visually present when a character speaks, or determining what is said when a visual event occurs--despite such cross-modal temporal relations being prevalent in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose ChronusOmni, an omni large language model designed to enhance temporal awareness for both explicit and implicit audiovisual temporal grounding. First, we interleave text-based timestamp tokens with visual and audio representations at each time unit, enabling unified temporal modeling across modalities. Second, to enforce correct temporal ordering and strengthen fine-grained temporal reasoning, we incorporate reinforcement learning with specially designed reward functions.

Existing 3D world generation models remain limited to single-scale synthesis and cannot produce coherent scene contents at varying granularities. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a scale-aware 3D representation capable of generating and rendering content with largely different spatial sizes. WonderZoom addresses this through two key innovations: (1) scale-adaptive Gaussian surfels for generating and real-time rendering of multi-scale 3D scenes, and (2) a progressive detail synthesizer that iteratively generates finer-scale 3D contents. Our approach enables users to \"zoom into\" a 3D region and auto-regressively synthesize previously non-existent fine details from landscapes to microscopic features. Experiments demonstrate that WonderZoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video and 3D models in both quality and alignment, enabling multi-scale 3D world creation from a single image.

Despite impressive fluency, these systems frequently produce biased or stereotypical content, especially when prompted with socially sensitive language. A growing body of research has demonstrated that such biases disproportionately affect low-resource languages, where training data is limited and culturally unrepresentative. This paper presents a comprehensive study of inference-time bias mitigation, a strategy that avoids retraining or fine-tuning and instead operates directly on model outputs. Building on preference-ranking models (PRMs), we introduce a unified evaluation framework comparing three methods: (1) baseline single-word generation, (2) PRM-Select best-of-N sampling, and (3) PRM-Sequential refinement guided by PRM critiques. We evaluate these techniques across 200 English prompts and their Urdu counterparts, designed to reflect socio-cultural contexts relevant to gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, disability, profession, age, and socioeconomic categories. Using GPT-3.5 as a candidate generator and GPT-4o-mini as a PRM-based bias and utility scorer, we provide an extensive quantitative analysis of bias reduction, utility preservation, and cross-lingual disparities. Our findings show: (a) substantial gains over the baseline for both languages; (b) consistently lower fairness scores for Urdu across all methods, highlighting structural inequities in multilingual LLM training; and (c) distinct improvement trajectories between PRM-Select and PRM-Sequential. The study contributes an extensible methodology, interpretable metrics, and cross-lingual comparisons that can support future work on fairness evaluation in low-resource languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u51cf\u8f7b\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u597d\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\uff08PRMs\uff09\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528GPT-3.5\u548cGPT-4o-mini\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e24\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u51cf\u8f7b\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u4fdd\u5b58\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u4f46\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5f97\u5206\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6PRM-Select\u548cPRM-Sequential\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u654f\u611f\u8bed\u8a00\u65f6\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u5e26\u6709\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\uff08PRMs\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6280\u672f\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u57fa\u7ebf\u5355\u8bcd\u751f\u6210\u3001\uff082\uff09PRM-Select\u6700\u597d\u7684N\u6b21\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u548c\uff083\uff09PRM-Sequential\u57fa\u4e8ePRM\u6279\u8bc4\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u5728200\u4e2a\u82f1\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5176\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u5bf9\u5e94\u7269\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u6027\u522b\u3001\u79cd\u65cf\u3001\u5b97\u6559\u3001\u56fd\u7c4d\u3001\u6b8b\u75be\u3001\u804c\u4e1a\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7c7b\u522b\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u4ea7\u751f\u53cd\u6620\u793e\u4ea4\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff1a\uff08a\uff09\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b\uff08b\uff09\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u4e0a\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\uff1b\uff08c\uff09PRM-Select\u548cPRM-Sequential\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8d21\u732e\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6307\u6807\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u672a\u6765\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"}}

This study establishes Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as a parameter-efficient framework to address these challenges in dedicated NMT architectures. We first demonstrate that LoRA-based fine-tuning adapts NMT models to new languages and domains with performance on par with full-parameter techniques, while utilizing only a fraction of the parameter space. Second, we propose an interactive adaptation method using a calibrated linear combination of LoRA modules. This approach functions as a gate-free mixture of experts, enabling real-time, user-controllable adjustments to domain and style without retraining. Finally, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a novel gradient-based regularization strategy specifically designed for low-rank decomposition matrices. Unlike methods that regularize the full parameter set, our approach weights the penalty on the low-rank updates using historical gradient information. Experimental results indicate that this strategy efficiently preserves prior domain knowledge while facilitating the acquisition of new tasks, offering a scalable paradigm for interactive and continual NMT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLoRA\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0cLoRA\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u9886\u57df\u548c\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5148\u524d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u548c\u9886\u57df\u53d8\u6362\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u65e0\u95e8\u63a7\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cLoRA\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u5148\u524d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8303\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "LoRA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

While recent generative approaches have attempted to model progression, key mismatches remain: disease dynamics are inherently continuous and monotonic, yet latent representations are often scattered, lacking semantic structure, and diffusion-based models disrupt continuity with random denoising process. In this work, we propose to treat the disease dynamic as a velocity field and leverage Flow Matching (FM) to align the temporal evolution of patient data. Unlike prior methods, it captures the intrinsic dynamic of disease, making the progression more interpretable. However, a key challenge remains: in latent space, Auto-Encoders (AEs) do not guarantee alignment across patients or correlation with clinical-severity indicators (e.g., age and disease conditions). To address this, we propose to learn patient-specific latent alignment, which enforces patient trajectories to lie along a specific axis, with magnitude increasing monotonically with disease severity. This leads to a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space. Together, we present $\u0394$-LFM, a framework for modeling patient-specific latent progression with flow matching.

To evaluate this hypothesis, we design and validate an efficient post-training and inference framework that enhances a video MLLM's reasoning capability. Our framework enables models to operate on compressed visual tokens and generate brief reasoning traces prior to answering. The resulting models achieve substantially improved inference efficiency, deliver competitive performance across diverse benchmarks, and avoid reliance on manual CoT annotations or supervised fine-tuning.

However, their training on sensitive patient data raises critical privacy and compliance challenges under regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, which enforce the \"right to be forgotten\". Unlearning, the process of tuning models to selectively remove the influence of specific training data points, offers a potential solution, yet its effectiveness in complex medical settings remains underexplored. To systematically study this, we introduce MedForget, a Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning Testbed with explicit retain and forget splits and evaluation sets containing rephrased variants. MedForget models hospital data as a nested hierarchy (Institution -> Patient -> Study -> Section), enabling fine-grained assessment across eight organizational levels. The benchmark contains 3840 multimodal (image, question, answer) instances, each hierarchy level having a dedicated unlearning target, reflecting distinct unlearning challenges. Experiments with four SOTA unlearning methods on three tasks (generation, classification, cloze) show that existing methods struggle to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without reducing diagnostic performance. To test whether unlearning truly deletes hierarchical pathways, we introduce a reconstruction attack that progressively adds hierarchical level context to prompts. Models unlearned at a coarse granularity show strong resistance, while fine-grained unlearning leaves models vulnerable to such reconstruction.

For text-to-PSD generation, OmniPSD arranges multiple target layers spatially into a single canvas and learns their compositional relationships through spatial attention, producing semantically coherent and hierarchically structured layers. For image-to-PSD decomposition, it performs iterative in-context editing, progressively extracting and erasing textual and foreground components to reconstruct editable PSD layers from a single flattened image. An RGBA-VAE is employed as an auxiliary representation module to preserve transparency without affecting structure learning.

However, existing segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), remain constrained to pixel-level predictions, lacking high-level global scene semantics and human-interpretable reasoning. To address this, we introduce GLACIA (\\textbf{G}lacial \\textbf{LA}ke segmentation with \\textbf{C}ontextual \\textbf{I}nstance \\textbf{A}wareness), the first framework that integrates large language models with segmentation capabilities to produce both accurate segmentation masks and corresponding spatial reasoning outputs. We construct the Glacial Lake Position Reasoning (GLake-Pos) dataset pipeline, which provides diverse, spatially grounded question-answer pairs designed to overcome the lack of instance-aware positional reasoning data in remote sensing. Comparative evaluation demonstrate that GLACIA (mIoU: 87.30) surpasses state-of-the-art method based on CNNs (mIoU: 78.55 - 79.01), ViTs (mIoU: 69.27 - 81.75), Geo-foundation models (mIoU: 76.37 - 87.10), and reasoning based segmentation methods (mIoU: 60.12 - 75.66).

However, one of the major remaining challenges lies in modeling long-range motion-contained dynamic videos, where a naive extension of existing methods leads to severe memory explosion, temporal flickering, and failure to handle appearing or disappearing occlusions over time. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 4DGS framework characterized by an Anchor Relay-based Bidirectional Blending (ARBB) mechanism, named MoRel, which enables temporally consistent and memory-efficient modeling of long-range dynamic scenes. Our method progressively constructs locally canonical anchor spaces at key-frame time index and models inter-frame deformations at the anchor level, enhancing temporal coherence. By learning bidirectional deformations between KfA and adaptively blending them through learnable opacity control, our approach mitigates temporal discontinuities and flickering artifacts. We further introduce a Feature-variance-guided Hierarchical Densification (FHD) scheme that effectively densifies KfA's while keeping rendering quality, based on an assigned level of feature-variance. To effectively evaluate our model's capability to handle real-world long-range 4D motion, we newly compose long-range 4D motion-contained dataset, called SelfCap$_{\\text{LR}}$. It has larger average dynamic motion magnitude, captured at spatially wider spaces, compared to previous dynamic video datasets. Overall, our MoRel achieves temporally coherent and flicker-free long-range 4D reconstruction while maintaining bounded memory usage, demonstrating both scalability and efficiency in dynamic Gaussian-based representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMoRel\u76844DGS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Anchor Relay-based Bidirectional Blending (ARBB)\u673a\u5236\u548cFeature-variance-guided Hierarchical Densification (FHD)\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb4D\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76844D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u957f\u671f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5185\u5b58\u81a8\u80c0\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u95ea\u70c1\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u6d88\u5931\u6216\u51fa\u73b0\u906e\u6321\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MoRel\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "MoRel\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u4e86Anchor Relay-based Bidirectional Blending (ARBB)\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u4e0a\u9010\u6b65\u6784\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u89c4\u8303\u951a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u90bb\u5e27\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Feature-variance-guided Hierarchical Densification (FHD)\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6709\u6548\u589e\u52a0\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "MoRel\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5177\u67094D\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u95ea\u70c1\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u540d\u4e3aSelfCap$_{\text{LR}}$\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30MoRel\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb4D\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MoRel\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u67094DGS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u671f\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, the existing T2I alignment benchmarks predominantly focus on short prompt scenarios and only provide MOS or Likert scale annotations. This inherent limitation hinders the development of long T2I evaluators, particularly in terms of the interpretability of alignment. In this study, we contribute LongT2IBench, which comprises 14K long text-image pairs accompanied by graph-structured human annotations. Given the detail-intensive nature of long prompts, we first design a Generate-Refine-Qualify annotation protocol to convert them into textual graph structures that encompass entities, attributes, and relations. Through this transformation, fine-grained alignment annotations are achieved based on these granular elements. Finally, the graph-structed annotations are converted into alignment scores and interpretations to facilitate the design of T2I evaluation models. Based on LongT2IBench, we further propose LongT2IExpert, a LongT2I evaluator that enables multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to provide both quantitative scores and structured interpretations through an instruction-tuning process with Hierarchical Alignment Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LongT2IExpert in alignment evaluation and interpretation.

While this line of work excels at reconstructing 3D geometry, the outputs are not colored 3D models, thus 3D colorization is required for visualization. Recent 3D colorization studies address this problem by distilling 2D image colorization models. However, these approaches suffer from an inherent inconsistency of 2D image models. This results in colors being averaged during training, leading to monotonous and oversimplified results, particularly in complex 360\u00b0 scenes. In contrast, we aim to preserve color diversity by generating a new set of consistently colorized training views, thereby bypassing the averaging process. Nevertheless, eliminating the averaging process introduces a new challenge: ensuring strict multi-view consistency across these colorized views. To achieve this, we propose LoGoColor, a pipeline designed to preserve color diversity by eliminating this guidance-averaging process with a `Local-Global' approach: we partition the scene into subscenes and explicitly tackle both inter-subscene and intra-subscene consistency using a fine-tuned multi-view diffusion model. We demonstrate that our method achieves quantitatively and qualitatively more consistent and plausible 3D colorization on complex 360\u00b0 scenes than existing methods, and validate its superior color diversity using a novel Color Diversity Index.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLoGoColor\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u5206\u5272\u6210\u5b50\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u660e\u786e\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u5b50\u573a\u666f\u548c\u5b50\u573a\u666f\u5185\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u989c\u8272\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u590d\u6742360\u00b0\u573a\u666f\u76843D\u989c\u8272\u5316\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u76843D\u989c\u8272\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e2D\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u989c\u8272\u5e73\u5747\u5316\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "LoGoColor\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u7ec6\u5206\u4e3a\u5b50\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6742360\u00b0\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0a\u90fd\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u5408\u7406\u76843D\u989c\u8272\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LoGoColor\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742360\u00b0\u573a\u666f\u76843D\u989c\u8272\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u989c\u8272\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

By leveraging the data mixing law, our method ensures a balanced dataset composition, enabling the model to achieve consistent generalization and comprehensive performance across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we introduce an effective Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven scheduler into generative pre-training to flexibly allocate task-adaptive diffusion priors for each restoration task, accounting for the distinct degradation forms and levels exhibited by different tasks.

As current state-of-the-art methods based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still suffer from the issue of differentiating classes across learning tasks. Here a novel VLM-based continual learning framework for image classification is proposed. In this framework, task-specific adapters are added to the pre-trained and frozen image encoder to learn new knowledge, and a novel cross-task representation calibration strategy based on a mixture of light-weight projectors is used to help better separate all learned classes in a unified feature space, alleviating class confusion across tasks. In addition, a novel inference strategy guided by prediction uncertainty is developed to more accurately select the most appropriate image feature for class prediction.

Time-lapse imaging enables continuous, non-invasive monitoring of embryo development, yet most automated assessment methods rely solely on conventional morphokinetic features and overlook emerging biomarkers. Cytoplasmic Strings, thin filamentous structures connecting the inner cell mass and trophectoderm in expanded blastocysts, have been associated with faster blastocyst formation, higher blastocyst grades, and improved viability. However, CS assessment currently depends on manual visual inspection, which is labor-intensive, subjective, and severely affected by detection and subtle visual appearance. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first computational framework for CS analysis in human IVF embryos. We first design a human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline to curate a biologically validated CS dataset from TLI videos, comprising 13,568 frames with highly sparse CS-positive instances. Building on this dataset, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework that (i) classifies CS presence at the frame level and (ii) localizes CS regions in positive cases. To address severe imbalance and feature uncertainty, we introduce the Novel Uncertainty-aware Contractive Embedding (NUCE) loss, which couples confidence-aware reweighting with an embedding contraction term to form compact, well-separated class clusters. NUCE consistently improves F1-score across five transformer backbones, while RF-DETR-based localization achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection performance for thin, low-contrast CS structures.

While lightweight baseline models such as U-Net, U-Net++, and PraNet offer advantages in terms of easy deployment and low computational cost, they struggle to deal with the above issues, leading to limited segmentation performance. In contrast, large-scale vision foundation models such as SAM, DINOv2, OneFormer, and Mask2Former have exhibited impressive generalization performance across natural image domains. However, their direct transfer to medical imaging tasks (e.g., colonoscopic polyp segmentation) is not straightforward, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale datasets and lack of domain-specific knowledge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel distillation framework, Polyp-DiFoM, that transfers the rich representations of foundation models into lightweight segmentation baselines, allowing efficient and accurate deployment in clinical settings. In particular, we infuse semantic priors from the foundation models into canonical architectures such as U-Net and U-Net++ and further perform frequency domain encoding for enhanced distillation, corroborating their generalization capability. Extensive experiments are performed across five benchmark datasets, such as Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, ETIS, ColonDB, and CVC-300. Notably, Polyp-DiFoM consistently outperforms respective baseline models significantly, as well as the state-of-the-art model, with nearly 9 times reduced computation overhead.

Building on our previously proposed privacy-preserving framework, this paper presents its first comprehensive validation on real-world data collected directly by industrial partners in active production environments. We evaluate the framework across three representative use cases: woodworking production monitoring, human-aware AGV navigation, and multi-camera ergonomic risk assessment. The approach employs learned visual transformations that obscure sensitive or task-irrelevant information while retaining features essential for task performance. Through both quantitative evaluation of the privacy-utility trade-off and qualitative feedback from industrial partners, we assess the framework's effectiveness, deployment feasibility, and trust implications. Results demonstrate that task-specific obfuscation enables effective monitoring with reduced privacy risks, establishing the framework's readiness for real-world adoption and providing cross-domain recommendations for responsible, human-centric AI deployment in industry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6728\u5de5\u751f\u4ea7\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u4eba\u673a\u611f\u77e5AGV\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f02\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u5316\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u5408\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u64cd\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u5458\u5de5\u9690\u79c1\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5de5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9009\u62e9\u6728\u5de5\u751f\u4ea7\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u4eba\u673a\u611f\u77e5AGV\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e09\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u4fdd\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u6765\u6a21\u7cca\u5316\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u9690\u79c1-\u6709\u7528\u6027\u6743\u8861\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e2d\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u4e14\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684AI\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u53ef\u4fc3\u8fdbAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u5458\u5de5\u9690\u79c1\u3002"}}

Despite extensive research on learning with noisy labels (LNL), the robustness of existing methods in medical imaging has not been systematically assessed. To address this gap, we introduce LNMBench, a comprehensive benchmark for Label Noise in Medical imaging. LNMBench encompasses \\textbf{10} representative methods evaluated across 7 datasets, 6 imaging modalities, and 3 noise patterns, establishing a unified and reproducible framework for robustness evaluation under realistic conditions. Comprehensive experiments reveal that the performance of existing LNL methods degrades substantially under high and real-world noise, highlighting the persistent challenges of class imbalance and domain variability in medical data.

However, modeling the listener is exceptionally challenging: direct audio-driven training fails, producing stiff, static listening motions. This failure stems from a fundamental imbalance: the speaker's motion is strongly driven by speech audio, while the listener's motion primarily follows an internal motion prior and is only loosely guided by external speech. This challenge has led most methods to focus on speak-only generation. The only prior attempt at joint generation relies on extra speaker's motion to produce the listener. This design is not end-to-end, thereby hindering the real-time applicability. To address this limitation, we present UniLS, the first end-to-end framework for generating unified speak-listen expressions, driven by only dual-track audio. Our method introduces a novel two-stage training paradigm. Stage 1 first learns the internal motion prior by training an audio-free autoregressive generator, capturing the spontaneous dynamics of natural facial motion. Stage 2 then introduces the dual-track audio, fine-tuning the generator to modulate the learned motion prior based on external speech cues. Extensive evaluations show UniLS achieves state-of-the-art speaking accuracy. More importantly, it delivers up to 44.1\\% improvement in listening metrics, generating significantly more diverse and natural listening expressions. This effectively mitigates the stiffness problem and provides a practical, high-fidelity audio-driven solution for interactive digital humans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bb2\u542c\u8868\u8fbe\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6UniLS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8f68\u9053\u97f3\u9891\u76f4\u63a5\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u5185\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u97f3\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002UniLS\u5728\u8bb2\u8bdd\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u542c\u529b\u8868\u8fbe\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u542c\u8005\u52a8\u4f5c\u50f5\u786c\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6UniLS\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "UniLS\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u97f3\u9891\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5185\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u8f68\u9053\u97f3\u9891\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "UniLS\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u8bb2\u8bdd\u51c6\u786e\u6027, \u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u542c\u529b\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0a\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u8fbe\u523044.1%\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u66f4\u52a0\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u542c\u8005\u8868\u8fbe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684UniLS\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u53cc\u8f68\u9053\u97f3\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u89e3\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u542c\u529b\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u523b\u677f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recently, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods have been employed to reconstruct the avatars. However, they often produce unsatisfactory photo-realistic results because of insufficient geometrical details related to body motion, such as clothing wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a 3DGS-based human avatar modeling framework, termed as Relightable and Dynamic Gaussian Avatar (RnD-Avatar), that presents accurate pose-variant deformation for high-fidelity geometrical details. To achieve this, we introduce dynamic skinning weights that define the human avatar's articulation based on pose while also learning additional deformations induced by body motion. We also introduce a novel regularization to capture fine geometric details under sparse visual cues. Furthermore, we present a new multi-view dataset with varied lighting conditions to evaluate relight.

However, applying these models to long-video understanding remains computationally intensive. Dense frame encoding generates excessive visual tokens, leading to high memory consumption, redundant computation, and limited scalability in real-world applications. This inefficiency highlights a key limitation of the traditional process-then-reason paradigm, which analyzes visual streams exhaustively before semantic reasoning. To address this challenge, we introduce Video-QTR (Query-Driven Temporal Reasoning), a lightweight framework that redefines video comprehension as a query-guided reasoning process. Instead of encoding every frame, Video-QTR dynamically allocates perceptual resources based on the semantic intent of the query, creating an adaptive feedback loop between reasoning and perception. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks: MSVD-QA, Activity Net-QA, Movie Chat, and Video MME demonstrate that Video-QTR achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing input frame consumption by up to 73%.

Current methods struggle with generalization due to the scarce annotated 3D scene data or noisy 2D segmentations. While synthetic data generation offers a promising solution, existing 3D scene synthesis methods fail to simultaneously satisfy geometry diversity, context complexity, and layout reasonability, each essential for this task. To address these needs, we propose an Adapted 3D Scene Synthesis pipeline for class-agnostic 3D Instance SegmenTation, termed as ASSIST-3D, to synthesize proper data for model generalization enhancement. Specifically, ASSIST-3D features three key innovations, including 1) Heterogeneous Object Selection from extensive 3D CAD asset collections, incorporating randomness in object sampling to maximize geometric and contextual diversity; 2) Scene Layout Generation through LLM-guided spatial reasoning combined with depth-first search for reasonable object placements; and 3) Realistic Point Cloud Construction via multi-view RGB-D image rendering and fusion from the synthetic scenes, closely mimicking real-world sensor data acquisition. Experiments on ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, and S3DIS benchmarks demonstrate that models trained with ASSIST-3D-generated data significantly outperform existing methods. Further comparisons underscore the superiority of our purpose-built pipeline over existing 3D scene synthesis approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "ASSIST-3D\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u7c7b\u65e0\u611f\u77e5\u76843D\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u76843D CAD\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u751f\u6210\u5408\u7406\u5e03\u5c40\u4ee5\u53ca\u6784\u5efa\u903c\u771f\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u57283D\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c2D\u5206\u5272\u4fe1\u606f\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b9e\u4f8b\u65f6\u3002ASSIST-3D\u65e8\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "ASSIST-3D\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\u70b9\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5176\u76ee\u6807\uff1a1) \u4ece\u5e7f\u6cdb\u76843D CAD\u8d44\u4ea7\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u5f02\u8d28\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b2) \u5229\u7528LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u5408\u7406\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5e03\u5c40\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u56feRGB-D\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u878d\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u903c\u771f\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ASSIST-3D\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728ScanNetV2\u3001ScanNet++\u548cS3DIS\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ASSIST-3D\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u7ba1\u9053\u5728\u63d0\u9ad83D\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper proposes FUSER, the first feed-forward multiview registration transformer that jointly processes all scans in a unified, compact latent space to directly predict global poses without any pairwise estimation. To maintain tractability, FUSER encodes each scan into low-resolution superpoint features via a sparse 3D CNN that preserves absolute translation cues, and performs efficient intra- and inter-scan reasoning through a Geometric Alternating Attention module. Particularly, we transfer 2D attention priors from off-the-shelf foundation models to enhance 3D feature interaction and geometric consistency. Building upon FUSER, we further introduce FUSER-DF, an SE(3)$^N$ diffusion refinement framework to correct FUSER's estimates via denoising in the joint SE(3)$^N$ space. FUSER acts as a surrogate multiview registration model to construct the denoiser, and a prior-conditioned SE(3)$^N$ variational lower bound is derived for denoising supervision.

It adopts a hierarchical binder structure for cross-attention conditioning in Diffusion Transformers to encode visual concepts into corresponding prompt tokens for accurate decomposition of complex visual concepts.

Subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical emergency, with increasing incidence in aging populations. Rapid and accurate identification is essential to guide timely intervention, yet existing automated tools focus primarily on detection and provide limited interpretability or spatial localization. There remains a need for transparent, high-performing systems that integrate multimodal clinical and imaging information to support real-time decision-making.\n  Methods. We developed a multimodal deep-learning framework that integrates structured clinical variables, a 3D convolutional neural network trained on CT volumes, and a transformer-enhanced 2D segmentation model for SDH detection and localization. Using 25,315 head CT studies from Hartford HealthCare (2015--2024), of which 3,774 (14.9\\%) contained clinician-confirmed SDH, tabular models were trained on demographics, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory results. Imaging models were trained to detect SDH and generate voxel-level probability maps. A greedy ensemble strategy combined complementary predictors.\n  Findings. Clinical variables alone provided modest discriminatory power (AUC 0.75). Convolutional models trained on CT volumes and segmentation-derived maps achieved substantially higher accuracy (AUCs 0.922 and 0.926).

Although recent studies have explored hyperbolic representations for better tackling the representation gap between different views, they focus primarily on instance-level alignment and neglect global semantic consistency, rendering them vulnerable to view-specific information (\\textit{e.g.}, noise and cross-view discrepancies). To this end, this paper proposes a novel Wasserstein-Aligned Hyperbolic (WAH) framework for multi-view clustering. Specifically, our method exploits a view-specific hyperbolic encoder for each view to embed features into the Lorentz manifold for hierarchical semantic modeling. Whereafter, a global semantic loss based on the hyperbolic sliced-Wasserstein distance is introduced to align manifold distributions across views. This is followed by soft cluster assignments to encourage cross-view semantic consistency.

Due to the lack of ground-truth paired swapping data, prior methods typically train on cross-frame pairs of the same person within a video and rely on mask-based inpainting to mitigate identity leakage. Beyond potential boundary artifacts, this paradigm struggles to recover essential cues occluded by the mask, such as facial pose, expressions, and motion dynamics. To address these issues, we prompt a video editing model to synthesize new heads for existing videos as fake swapping inputs, while maintaining frame-synchronized facial poses and expressions. This yields HeadSwapBench, the first cross-identity paired dataset for video head swapping, which supports both training (\\TrainNum{} videos) and benchmarking (\\TestNum{} videos) with genuine outputs. Leveraging this paired supervision, we propose DirectSwap, a mask-free, direct video head-swapping framework that extends an image U-Net into a video diffusion model with a motion module and conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Motion- and Expression-Aware Reconstruction (MEAR) loss, which reweights the diffusion loss per pixel using frame-difference magnitudes and facial-landmark proximity, thereby enhancing cross-frame coherence in motion and expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectSwap achieves state-of-the-art visual quality, identity fidelity, and motion and expression consistency across diverse in-the-wild video scenes.

We propose the Motion Conditioned Diffusion Model (MCDM), a label-free latent diffusion framework that synthesises realistic echocardiography videos conditioned on self-supervised motion features. To extract these features, we design the Motion and Appearance Feature Extractor (MAFE), which disentangles motion and appearance representations from videos. Feature learning is further enhanced by two auxiliary objectives: a re-identification loss guided by pseudo appearance features and an optical flow loss guided by pseudo flow fields.

In this work, we propose a novel approach for distilling a compact synthetic echocardiographic video dataset. Our method leverages motion feature extraction to capture temporal dynamics, followed by class-wise graph construction and representative sample selection using the Infomap algorithm.

However, existing methods either rely on implicit part segmentation with limited granularity control or depend on strong external segmenters trained on large annotated datasets. In this work, we observe that part awareness emerges naturally during whole-object geometry learning and propose Geom-Seg VecSet, a unified geometry-segmentation latent representation that jointly encodes object geometry and part-level structure. Building on this representation, we introduce UniPart, a two-stage latent diffusion framework for image-guided part-level 3D generation.

However, these models often neglect fine-grained details, such as which kind of anomalies, like \"hole\", \"cut\", \"scratch\" that could provide more specific insight into the nature of anomalies. We argue that recognizing fine-grained anomaly types 1) enriches the representation of \"abnormal\" with structured semantics, narrowing the gap between coarse anomaly signals and fine-grained defect categories; 2) enables manufacturers to understand the root causes of the anomaly and implement more targeted and appropriate corrective measures quickly. While incorporating such detailed semantic information is crucial, designing handcrafted prompts for each defect type is both time-consuming and susceptible to human bias. For this reason, we introduce DAPO, a novel approach for Defect-aware Prompt Optimization based on progressive tuning for the zero-shot multi-type and binary anomaly detection and segmentation under distribution shifts. Our approach aligns anomaly-relevant image features with their corresponding text semantics by learning hybrid defect-aware prompts with both fixed textual anchors and learnable token embeddings. We conducted experiments on public benchmarks (MPDD, VisA, MVTec-AD, MAD, and Real-IAD) and an internal dataset. The results suggest that compared to the baseline models, DAPO achieves a 3.7% average improvement in AUROC and average precision metrics at the image level under distribution shift, and a 6.5% average improvement in localizing novel anomaly types under zero-shot settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDAPO\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u5316\u7f3a\u9677\u7c7b\u578b\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002DAPO\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u867d\u7136\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5982\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5236\u9020\u5546\u53ea\u80fd\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u73b0\u8c61\u8fdb\u884c\u7c97\u7565\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u627e\u5230\u66f4\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u4ee5\u91c7\u53d6\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u539f\u56e0\u3002DAPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u7c7b\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5236\u9020\u5546\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u6545\u969c\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5e76\u8fc5\u901f\u5b9e\u65bd\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "method": "DAPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5e26\u6709\u56fa\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u951a\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee4\u724c\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7f3a\u9677\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u9010\u6b65\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff08\u5982MPDD\u3001VisA\u3001MVTec-AD\u3001MAD\u548cReal-IAD\uff09\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cDAPO\u5728AUROC\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863.7%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b0\u578b\u7f3a\u9677\u7c7b\u578b\u65f6\uff0cDAPO\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u57476.5%\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "DAPO\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u7c7b\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5236\u9020\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8fc5\u901f\u627e\u5230\u6545\u969c\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5e76\u91c7\u53d6\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

Multispectral images (MSIs) capture additional spectral cues across multiple bands, offering a promising alternative. However, the lack of training data has been the primary bottleneck to exploiting the potential of MSIs. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale dataset for Multispectral Object Detection in Aerial images (MODA), which comprises 14,041 MSIs and 330,191 annotations across diverse, challenging scenarios, providing a comprehensive data foundation for this field. Furthermore, to overcome challenges inherent to aerial object detection using MSIs, we propose OSSDet, a framework that integrates spectral and spatial information with object-aware cues. OSSDet employs a cascaded spectral-spatial modulation structure to optimize target perception, aggregates spectrally related features by exploiting spectral similarities to reinforce intra-object correlations, and suppresses irrelevant background via object-aware masking. Moreover, cross-spectral attention further refines object-related representations under explicit object-aware guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSSDet outperforms existing methods with comparable parameters and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u7a7a\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6MODA\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aOSSDet\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7269\u4f53\u5185\u90e8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u65e0\u5173\u80cc\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684RGB\u57fa\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53d7\u5230\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\uff08MSIs\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u989d\u5916\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6398\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OSSDet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u53ca\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u8c31\u7a7a\u95f4\u8c03\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5149\u8c31\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6765\u805a\u5408\u5149\u8c31\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7269\u4f53\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\u6291\u5236\u65e0\u5173\u80cc\u666f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8de8\u8c31\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5728\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u7ec6\u5316\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u540c\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cOSSDet\u5728\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MODA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cOSSDet\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

CNN-based SSL struggles to capture disease patterns that evolve continuously along leaf structures, while transformer-based SSL introduces quadratic attention cost from high-resolution patches. To address these limitations, we propose StateSpace-SSL, a linear-time SSL framework that employs a Vision Mamba state-space encoder to model long-range lesion continuity through directional scanning across the leaf surface.

However, these models often produce textual descriptions that contradict their final quality predictions, and the predicted scores can change unstably during inference - behaviors not aligned with human reasoning. To understand these issues, we analyze the factors that cause contradictory assessments and instability. We first estimate the relationship between the final quality predictions and the generated visual features, finding that the predictions are not fully grounded in the features and that the logical connection between them is weak. Moreover, decoding intermediate VLM layers shows that the model frequently relies on a limited set of candidate tokens, which contributes to prediction instability. To encourage more human-like reasoning, we introduce a two-stage tuning method that explicitly separates visual perception from quality inference. In the first stage, the model learns visual features; in the second, it infers quality solely from these features. Experiments on SPAQ and KONIQ demonstrate that our approach reduces prediction instability from 22.00% to 12.39% and achieves average gains of 0.3124/0.3507 in SRCC/PLCC across LIVE, CSIQ, SPAQ, and KONIQ compared to the baseline.

However, despite their strong visual perception modules, these models often fail to reliably detect basic low-level distortions such as blur, noise, and compression, and may produce inconsistent evaluations across repeated inferences. This raises an essential question: do MLLM-based IQA systems truly perceive the visual features that matter? To examine this issue, we introduce a low-level distortion perception task that requires models to classify specific distortion types. Our component-wise analysis shows that although MLLMs are structurally capable of representing such distortions, they tend to overfit training templates, leading to biases in quality scoring. As a result, critical low-level features are weakened or lost during the vision-language alignment transfer stage. Furthermore, by computing the semantic distance between visual features and corresponding semantic tokens before and after component-wise fine-tuning, we show that improving the alignment of the vision encoder dramatically enhances distortion recognition accuracy, increasing it from 14.92% to 84.43%. Overall, these findings indicate that incorporating dedicated constraints on the vision encoder can strengthen text-explainable visual representations and enable MLLM-based pipelines to produce more coherent and interpretable reasoning in vision-centric tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u7ea7\u5931\u771f\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08IQA\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u793a\u4f4e\u7ea7\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5173\u952e\u7684\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u9636\u6bb5\u53d7\u5230\u524a\u5f31\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u5584\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5931\u771f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1MLLMs\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u672c\u4f4e\u7ea7\u5931\u771f\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u538b\u7f29\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8eMLLMs\u7684IQA\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u7ea7\u5931\u771f\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5931\u771f\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6539\u8fdb\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u5931\u771f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u8bb0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5bf9\u9f50\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1MLLMs\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u793a\u4f4e\u7ea7\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u51fa\u73b0\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u5584\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5931\u771f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u4ece14.92%\u63d0\u5347\u523084.43%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5316\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u57fa\u4e8eMLLMs\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

Existing approaches mainly rely on uniform pixel-wise color mapping across entire images, neglecting the inherent color variations induced by image content. This limitation hinders existing approaches from achieving adaptive retouching that accommodates both diverse color distributions and user-defined style preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Content-Adaptive image retouching method guided by Attribute-based Text Representation (CA-ATP). Specifically, we propose a content-adaptive curve mapping module, which leverages a series of basis curves to establish multiple color mapping relationships and learns the corresponding weight maps, enabling content-aware color adjustments. The proposed module can capture color diversity within the image content, allowing similar color values to receive distinct transformations based on their spatial context. In addition, we propose an attribute text prediction module that generates text representations from multiple image attributes, which explicitly represent user-defined style preferences. These attribute-based text representations are subsequently integrated with visual features via a multimodal model, providing user-friendly guidance for image retouching.

We present UnReflectAnything, an RGB-only framework that removes highlights from a single image by predicting a highlight map together with a reflection-free diffuse reconstruction. The model uses a frozen vision transformer encoder to extract multi-scale features, a lightweight head to localize specular regions, and a token-level inpainting module that restores corrupted feature patches before producing the final diffuse image. To overcome the lack of paired supervision, we introduce a Virtual Highlight Synthesis pipeline that renders physically plausible specularities using monocular geometry, Fresnel-aware shading, and randomized lighting which enables training on arbitrary RGB images with correct geometric structure. UnReflectAnything generalizes across natural and surgical domains where non-Lambertian surfaces and non-uniform lighting create severe highlights and it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.

To address this challenging issue, we proposed the CS3D framework by decomposing the Convolutional 3D method to reduce the computational complexity and energy consumption. Additionally, by utilizing soft spiking neurons and a spatial-temporal attention mechanism, the ability to retain information is enhanced, thus improving the accuracy of facial expression detection. Experimental results indicate that our proposed CS3D method attains higher accuracy on multiple datasets compared to architectures such as the RNN, Transformer, and C3D, while the energy consumption of the CS3D method is just 21.97\\% of the original C3D required on the same device.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CS3D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u5377\u79ef3D\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6f\u5c16\u5cf0\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u9ad8\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u670d\u52a1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CS3D\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "CS3D\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e33D\u5377\u79ef\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6f\u5c16\u5cf0\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cCS3D\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8eRNN\u3001Transformer\u548cC3D\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u8017\u4ec5\u4e3aC3D\u768421.97%\u3002", "conclusion": "CS3D\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u5728\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, compared to meshes or radiance fields, existing multiview diffusion models offer limited appearance manipulation, particularly in terms of material, texture, or style.\n  In this paper, we present a lightweight adaptation technique for appearance transfer in multiview diffusion models. Our method learns to combine object identity from an input image with appearance cues rendered in a separate reference image, producing multi-view-consistent output that reflects the desired materials, textures, or styles. This allows explicit specification of appearance parameters at generation time while preserving the underlying object geometry and view coherence. We leverage three diffusion denoising processes responsible for generating the original object, the reference, and the target images, and perform reverse sampling to aggregate a small subset of layer-wise self-attention features from the object and the reference to influence the target generation. Our method requires only a few training examples to introduce appearance awareness to pretrained multiview models. The experiments show that our method provides a simple yet effective way toward multiview generation with diverse appearance, advocating the adoption of implicit generative 3D representations in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u7ebf\u7d22\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u660e\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u6750\u6599\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u6216\u6837\u5f0f\u3002\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u793a\u4f8b\u5373\u53ef\u5f15\u5165\u5916\u89c2\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6750\u6599\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u6216\u98ce\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u64cd\u7eb5\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8be5\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u91c7\u6837\u805a\u5408\u6765\u81ea\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u9010\u5c42\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u76ee\u6807\u751f\u6210\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4f7f\u5916\u89c2\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u660e\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u4f53\u57fa\u7840\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5021\u5bfc\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u9690\u5f0f\u7684\u751f\u62103D\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u89c2\u8f6c\u79fb\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6750\u6599\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u6216\u98ce\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Our research concentrates on a fundamental sub-problem: the fine-grained classification of atomic interaction states, namely 'approaching', 'grabbing', and 'holding'. To this end, we introduce a structured data engineering process that converts raw videos from the MANIAC dataset into 27,476 statistical-kinematic feature vectors. Each vector encapsulates relational and dynamic properties from a short temporal window of motion. Our initial hypothesis posited that sequential modeling would be critical, leading us to compare static classifiers (MLPs) against temporal models (RNNs). Counter-intuitively, the key discovery occurred when we set the sequence length of a Bidirectional RNN to one (seq_length=1). This modification converted the network's function, compelling it to act as a high-capacity static feature encoder. This architectural change directly led to a significant accuracy improvement, culminating in a final score of 97.60%. Of particular note, our optimized model successfully overcame the most challenging transitional class, 'grabbing', by achieving a balanced F1-score of 0.90.

Incorporating controllability in video generation further adds to the complexity. Existing controllable video generation approaches face a trade-off: sparse controls like keypoint trajectories are easy to specify but lack instance-awareness, while dense signals such as optical flow, depths or 3D meshes are informative but costly to obtain. We propose VHOI, a two-stage framework that first densifies sparse trajectories into HOI mask sequences, and then fine-tunes a video diffusion model conditioned on these dense masks. We introduce a novel HOI-aware motion representation that uses color encodings to distinguish not only human and object motion, but also body-part-specific dynamics. This design incorporates a human prior into the conditioning signal and strengthens the model's ability to understand and generate realistic HOI dynamics. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in controllable HOI video generation. VHOI is not limited to interaction-only scenarios and can also generate full human navigation leading up to object interactions in an end-to-end manner.

Based on this benchmark, we systematically evaluate over 40 open-source and closed-source MLLMs, employing cyclic evaluation, bilingual assessment, and hybrid judgment strategies to enhance the reliability of the results. Our analysis reveals how model scale, architecture, and inference paradigms affect infrared image comprehension, providing valuable insights for this area. Furthermore, we propose a training-free generative visual prompting (GenViP) method, which leverages advanced image editing models to translate infrared images into semantically and spatially aligned RGB counterparts, thereby mitigating domain distribution shifts.

This paper introduces a fully automated Tip-and-Cue framework designed for satellite imaging tasking and scheduling. In this context, tips are generated from external data sources or analyses of prior satellite imagery, identifying spatiotemporal targets and prioritizing them for downstream planning. Corresponding cues are the imaging tasks formulated in response, which incorporate sensor constraints, timing requirements, and utility functions. The system autonomously generates candidate tasks, optimizes their scheduling across multiple satellites using continuous utility functions that reflect the expected value of each observation, and processes the resulting imagery using artificial-intelligence-based models, including object detectors and vision-language models. Structured visual reports are generated to support both interpretability and the identification of new insights for downstream tasking.

However, previous studies show that generated images often resemble the training data, and this problem becomes more severe as the model size increases. Memorizing training data can lead to legal challenges, including copyright infringement, violations of portrait rights, and trademark violations. Existing approaches to mitigating memorization mainly focus on manipulating the denoising sampling process to steer image embeddings away from the memorized embedding space or employ unlearning methods that require training on datasets containing specific sets of memorized concepts. However, existing methods often incur substantial computational overhead during sampling, or focus narrowly on removing one or more groups of target concepts, imposing a significant limitation on their scalability. To understand and mitigate these problems, our work, UniForget, offers a new perspective on understanding the root cause of memorization. Our work demonstrates that specific parts of the model are responsible for copyrighted content generation. By applying model pruning, we can effectively suppress the probability of generating copyrighted content without targeting specific concepts while preserving the general generative capabilities of the model.

Preprint version", "summary": "Estimating the 6-degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) pose of a spacecraft from a single image is critical for autonomous operations like in-orbit servicing and space debris removal. Existing state-of-the-art methods often rely on iterative Perspective-n-Point (PnP)-based algorithms, which are computationally intensive and ill-suited for real-time deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose FastPose-ViT, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture that directly regresses the 6DoF pose. Our approach processes cropped images from object bounding boxes and introduces a novel mathematical formalism to map these localized predictions back to the full-image scale. This formalism is derived from the principles of projective geometry and the concept of \"apparent rotation\", where the model predicts an apparent rotation matrix that is then corrected to find the true orientation. We demonstrate that our method outperforms other non-PnP strategies and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art PnP-based techniques on the SPEED dataset. Furthermore, we validate our model's suitability for real-world space missions by quantizing it and deploying it on power-constrained edge hardware.

However, existing SSL approaches for multi-modal medical imaging often struggle to exploit the complementary information between modalities due to semantic discrepancies and misalignment across MRI sequences. To address this, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal framework that explicitly enhances modality-specific representations and facilitates adaptive cross-modal information fusion. Specifically, we introduce a Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) to strengthen semantic cues unique to each modality via channel-wise attention, and a learnable Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module to adaptively exchange complementary knowledge between modalities. The overall framework is optimized using a hybrid objective combining supervised segmentation loss and cross-modal consistency regularization on unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2019 (HGG subset) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong semi-supervised and multi-modal baselines under 1\\%, 5\\%, and 10\\% labeled data settings, achieving significant improvements in both Dice and Sensitivity scores.

A prominent interest pertains to the integration of an image prompt adapter to facilitate zero-shot PT2I without test-time fine-tuning. However, current methods grapple with three fundamental challenges: 1. the elusive equilibrium between Concept Preservation (CP) and Prompt Following (PF), 2. the difficulty in retaining fine-grained concept details in reference images, and 3. the restricted scalability to extend to multi-subject personalization. To tackle these challenges, we present Dynamic Image Prompt Adapter (DynaIP), a cutting-edge plugin to enhance the fine-grained concept fidelity, CP-PF balance, and subject scalability of SOTA T2I multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) for PT2I generation. Our key finding is that MM-DiT inherently exhibit decoupling learning behavior when injecting reference image features into its dual branches via cross attentions. Based on this, we design an innovative Dynamic Decoupling Strategy that removes the interference of concept-agnostic information during inference, significantly enhancing the CP-PF balance and further bolstering the scalability of multi-subject compositions. Moreover, we identify the visual encoder as a key factor affecting fine-grained CP and reveal that the hierarchical features of commonly used CLIP can capture visual information at diverse granularity levels. Therefore, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts Feature Fusion Module to fully leverage the hierarchical features of CLIP, remarkably elevating the fine-grained concept fidelity while also providing flexible control of visual granularity.

We reformulate struggle localization as an online detection task and further extend it to anticipation, predicting struggle moments before they occur. We adapt two off-the-shelf models as baselines for online struggle detection and anticipation. Online struggle detection achieves 70-80% per-frame mAP, while struggle anticipation up to 2 seconds ahead yields comparable performance with slight drops. We further examine generalization across tasks and activities and analyse the impact of skill evolution. Despite larger domain gaps in activity-level generalization, models still outperform random baselines by 4-20%.

Existing vision-language-action (VLA)-based methods cannot leverage unlabeled videos for visual causal learning, while world model-based methods lack reasoning capabilities from large language models. In this paper, we construct multiple specialized datasets providing reasoning and planning annotations for complex scenarios. Then, a unified Understanding-Generation-Planning framework, named UniUGP, is proposed to synergize scene reasoning, future video generation, and trajectory planning through a hybrid expert architecture. By integrating pre-trained VLMs and video generation models, UniUGP leverages visual dynamics and semantic reasoning to enhance planning performance.

The critical challenges are how to model the spectral prior distribution and spectral variability. Prior knowledge and spectral variability can be rigorously modeled under the Bayesian framework, where posterior estimation of Abundance is derived by combining observed data with endmember prior distribution. Considering the key challenges and the advantages of the Bayesian framework, a novel method using a diffusion posterior sampler for semiblind unmixing, denoted as DPS4Un, is proposed to deal with these challenges with the following features: (1) we view the pretrained conditional spectrum diffusion model as a posterior sampler, which can combine the learned endmember prior with observation to get the refined abundance distribution. (2) Instead of using the existing spectral library as prior, which may raise bias, we establish the image-based endmember bundles within superpixels, which are used to train the endmember prior learner with diffusion model. Superpixels make sure the sub-scene is more homogeneous. (3) Instead of using the image-level data consistency constraint, the superpixel-based data fidelity term is proposed. (4) The endmember is initialized as Gaussian noise for each superpixel region, DPS4Un iteratively updates the abundance and endmember, contributing to spectral variability modeling. The experimental results on three real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that DPS4Un outperforms the state-of-the-art hyperspectral unmixing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDPS4Un\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5f71\u50cf\u89e3\u6df7\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5149\u8c31\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u7ea7\u50cf\u7d20\u5185\u7684\u7aef\u5143\u5148\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u7ea7\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u771f\u9879\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u6df7\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ebf\u6027\u5149\u8c31\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMM\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5355\u50cf\u7d20\u4e2d\u6750\u6599\uff08\u7aef\u5143\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff08\u4e30\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u5982\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\u5149\u8c31\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u8c31\u5e93\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DPS4Un\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5149\u8c31\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u548c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u7ea7\u50cf\u7d20\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u7aef\u5143\u5148\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u7ea7\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u771f\u9879\uff0c\u5e76\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7aef\u5143\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u5149\u8c31\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDPS4Un\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u89e3\u6df7\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DPS4Un\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u5f71\u50cf\u89e3\u6df7\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u6781\u5927\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u7aef\u5143\u548c\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u6df7\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce a novel benchmarking framework centered on synthetically generated PDFs with precise LaTeX ground truth, enabling systematic control over layout, formulas, and content characteristics. A key methodological contribution is pioneering LLM-as-a-judge for semantic formula assessment, combined with a robust two-stage matching pipeline that handles parser output inconsistencies. Through human validation on 250 formula pairs (750 ratings from 30 evaluators), we demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation achieves substantially higher correlation with human judgment (Pearson r=0.78) compared to CDM (r=0.34) and text similarity (r~0). Evaluating 20+ contemporary PDF parsers (including specialized OCR models, vision-language models, and rule-based approaches) across 100 synthetic documents with 2,000+ formulas reveals significant performance disparities.

This direction offers efficient rendering and seamless integration with diffusion-based pipelines. However, these methods face a fundamental limitation: The VAE latent space lacks multi-view consistency, leading to blurred textures and missing details during 3D reconstruction. Existing approaches attempt to address this by fine-tuning the VAE, at the cost of reconstruction quality, or by relying on pre-trained diffusion models to recover fine-grained details, at the risk of some hallucinations. We present Splatent, a diffusion-based enhancement framework designed to operate on top of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in the latent space of VAEs. Our key insight departs from the conventional 3D-centric view: rather than reconstructing fine-grained details in 3D space, we recover them in 2D from input views through multi-view attention mechanisms. This approach preserves the reconstruction quality of pretrained VAEs while achieving faithful detail recovery. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, Splatent establishes a new state-of-the-art for VAE latent radiance field reconstruction. We further demonstrate that integrating our method with existing feed-forward frameworks, consistently improves detail preservation, opening new possibilities for high-quality sparse-view 3D reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Splatent \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728VAE\u7684\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7ed3\u54083D\u9ad8\u65af\u6591\u70b9\u7ed8\u5236\uff083DGS\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u56fe\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VAE\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be6\u5c3d\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u6062\u590d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684VAE\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u6216\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002Splatent\u6846\u67b6\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Splatent\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u75283D\u9ad8\u65af\u6591\u70b9\u7ed8\u5236\u6280\u672f\u5728VAE\u7684\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u56fe\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u57283D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "Splatent\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230VAE\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "Splatent\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ec6\u8282\u6062\u590d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u524d\u9988\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u5584\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

We attribute this gap to two factors: 1) existing datasets are inadequate for training and evaluating reasoning-aware video editing, and 2) an inherent disconnect between the models' reasoning and editing capabilities, which prevents the rich understanding from effectively instructing the editing process. Bridging this gap requires an integrated framework that connects reasoning with visual transformation. To address this gap, we introduce the Reason-Informed Video Editing (RVE) task, which requires reasoning about physical plausibility and causal dynamics during editing. To support systematic evaluation, we construct RVE-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with two complementary subsets: Reasoning-Informed Video Editing and In-Context Video Generation. These subsets cover diverse reasoning dimensions and real-world editing scenarios. Building upon this foundation, we propose the ReViSE, a Self-Reflective Reasoning (SRF) framework that unifies generation and evaluation within a single architecture. The model's internal VLM provides intrinsic feedback by assessing whether the edited video logically satisfies the given instruction. The differential feedback that refines the generator's reasoning behavior during training.

However, these methods degrade sharply under sparse-view settings, where limited observations lead to severe ambiguity between geometry, reflectance, and lighting. We introduce GAINS (Gaussian-based Inverse rendering from Sparse multi-view captures), a two-stage inverse rendering framework that leverages learning-based priors to stabilize geometry and material estimation. GAINS first refines geometry using monocular depth/normal and diffusion priors, then employs segmentation, intrinsic image decomposition (IID), and diffusion priors to regularize material recovery. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that GAINS significantly improves material parameter accuracy, relighting quality, and novel-view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods, especially under sparse-view settings.
